Dear Prof. Erol Kurt
 and Dr. Bekir Dursun,
 
We are pleased to learn that our abstract (ID 144 
Evaluation of iron contamination in silicon solar cells via photovoltaic parameters) 
was accepted for oral
presentation at The 11 European Conference on Renewable Energy Systems.
We like to thank the Organizing Committee for their interest in our research.
This Conference enjoys well-deserved respect and participation is very important for us.

I am very uncomfortable, but we have to ask the Organizing Committee 
for financial support for the Virtual presentation. 
However, lately, Ukrainian scientists are experiencing various difficulties, including financial ones.
Now 300 Euro is an unrealistic amount for us. 
We ask the organizing committee to find a way to reduce 
the registration fee for virtual participation to 50 euros.

I look forward to your support and seeing you at ECRES 2023.
 
 Best regards,

Dear Dr. Yunus UZUN,

Unfortunately, I never knew how to negotiate. I probably should have asked for full participation support. Maybe the organizing company could increase the discount and reduce the fee to 50 Euros?

Best regards,
