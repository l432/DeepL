abstract = {This paper presents a novel meta-heuristic algorithm so-called White Shark Optimizer (WSO) to solve optimization problems over a continuous search space. The core ideas and underpinnings of WSO are inspired by the behaviors of great white sharks, including their exceptional senses of hearing and smell while navigating and foraging. These aspects of behavior are mathematically modeled to accommodate a sufficiently adequate balance between exploration and exploitation of WSO and to assist search agents to explore and exploit each potential area of the search space in order to achieve optimization. The search agents of WSO randomly update their position in connection with best-so-far solutions, to eventually arrive at the optimal outcome. The performance of WSO was comprehensively benchmarked on a set of 29 test functions from the CEC-2017 test suite for several dimensions. WSO was further applied to solve the benchmark problems of the CEC-2011 evolutionary algorithm competition to prove its reliability and applicability to real-world problems. A thorough analysis of computational and convergence results was presented to shed light on the efficacy and stability levels of WSO. The performance score of WSO in terms of several statistical methods was compared with 9 well-established meta-heuristics based on the solutions generated. Friedman’s and Holm’s tests of the results showed that WSO revealed reasonable solutions, in terms of global optimality, avoidance of local minima and solution quality, compared to other existing meta-heuristics.}
