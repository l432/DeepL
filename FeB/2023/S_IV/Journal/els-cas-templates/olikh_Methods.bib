  abstract = {{In this work, we performed a study on the recovery of the photovoltaic performance of an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Ca/Al solar cell after the hole transport layer (PEDOT:PSS) had been degraded by contact with the environment. A device that was fully built in an inert environment exhibited a fill factor (FF) of 0.64, while the device whose hole transport layer was exposed to air presented a FF equal to 0.2. In addition, the J-V characteristic curve of the degraded device did not follow the photovoltaic pattern exhibiting the degenerate S shape. However, the elimination of the deleterious effect was achieved by bombarding gold ions on the contaminated surface of PEDOT:PSS by means of the Metal Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation technique. Due to the low energy of the ionic beam of gold, the implanted gold atoms were located at few nanometers off the surface, forming nanometric clusters, that is, gold nanoparticles. Most probably, the degradation of the J-V photovoltaic curve, represented by the S-kink effect, was caused by the appearance of a potential barrier at PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM interface, which was demolished by the gold nanoparticles that have work function close to HOMO of P3HT. This S-kink effect was also simulated by using an equivalent circuit model constituted by a two-diode circuit, one of which plays the role of the undesirable potential barrier formed at the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM interface. Our analysis shows that deposition of gold nanoparticles next to the interface recovers the good hole injection condition from the PEDOT:PSS into the active layer, restoring the fill factor and the device efficiency.}},

ACA has many good features in optimization, but it has the limitations of stagnation and poor convergence, and is easy to fall in local optimization. Pointing at these disadvantages, Artificial fish-swarm algorithm(AFSA) is presented to conquer the disadvantages. The algorithm of rapid search capability of AFSA and the good search characteristics of ACO, and the convergent speed of the presented algorithm avoiding being trapped in local optimum is improved.},

  abstract = {The present paper proposes a novel nature-inspired optimization paradigm, which is called the Water Strider Algorithm (WSA). The WSA is a population-based optimizer inspired by the life cycle of water strider bugs. The WSA mimics territorial behavior, intelligent ripple communication, mating style, feeding mechanisms and succession of water striders. The algorithm is mathematically formulated and benchmarked on forty-four numerical problems, four classic examples, two large scale structural size optimization and one structural damage identifying applications. In two phases, the algorithm is investigated to prove its promising performance against possible biases. Different parametric and nonparametric tests, as well as comparison with well-established and state of the art algorithms, indicate the efficient performance of the proposed WSA. The algorithm is applied to classical constrained, unconstrained, continuous and discrete structural design problems confirming its capability of tackling various challenging problems. The paper also presents a real application of the proposed method in structural health monitoring, in which the WSA effectively identified the damage scenarios.},

Competitive behaviors could be observed in many aspects of human social life. Our proposed algorithm is a stochastic, iterative and population-based global optimization technique like genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimizations. Particularly, our method tries to simulate the intra and inter group competitions in trying to take the control of the parliament. Performance of this method for function optimization over some benchmark multi-dimensional functions, of which global and local minimums are known, is compared with traditional genetic algorithms.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces a new social metaheuristic for the Max-Cut problem applied to a weighted undirected graph. This problem consists in finding a partition of the nodes into two subsets, such that the sum of the weights of the edges having endpoints in different subsets is maximized. This NP-hard problem for non planar graphs has several application areas such as VLSI and ASICs CAD. The hierarchical social (HS) metaheuristic here proposed for solving the referred problem is tested and compared with other two metaheuristics: a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) and an hybrid memetic heuristic that combines a genetic algorithm (GA) and a local search. The computational results on a set of standard test problems show the suitability of the approach.},
