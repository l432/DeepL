ADELI improved version of DE incorporates three main elements:
local search using Lagrange interpolation, self-adaptive DE control parameter settings,
and an adaptive mutational strategy \cite{ADELI}.
The first element involves interpolating three potential solutions using a
polynomial function to calculate the local minimum value.
The self-adaptive control parameter settings include randomly altering the
scaling factor and crossover rate values in each iteration.
The adaptive mutational strategy determines the probability of
employing Lagrange interpolation in each generation based on the best fitness function value.
These incorporations aim to enhance exploitation capability and speed up the convergence.

The information was added to the revised manuscript (page~6, paragraph~2).

In STLBO, the teacher phase is redefined and simplified, while the learner phase remains unchanged \cite{STLBO}.
In the redefined teacher phase, the mutation of potential solutions is possible,
with the mutation probability decreasing as the iteration number increases.
During the early stages, a higher mutation probability helps explore a larger solution space
and approach the optimum quickly.
However, in the latter stages of optimization, when the teacher (best solution) is near the global optimum,
a lower mutation probability serves as a fine-tuning mechanism
to enhance local search capability, proving to be an effective strategy.
To enrich the mutation behavior, a chaotic sequence is introduced to generate values for the mutation parameters.
A chaotic sequence is a deterministic, random-like process found in nonlinear dynamic systems,
which is non-periodic, non-converging, and bounded \cite{May1976}.
Additionally, the elite strategy replaces the worst solutions in the current population with new solutions based on objective function values.

The information was added to the revised manuscript (page~7, paragraph~3).

Unfortunately, providing a detailed description of each algorithm requires too much space.
However, the paper includes references that allow obtaining additional information.

Furthermore, some speculation about possible modification of meta--heuristic algorithms
to successful solving the parameter estimation problem for S-shaped \emph{IV} curves was added (page 17, 2--nd paragraph from the bottom)

We would also like to express our gratitude to the Reviewer for providing exceptionally insightful references.
We hope the Reviewer will not object to their inclusion in the revised manuscript (references 1, 2, 3, 91, 92).

Additionally, the idea of employing meta-heuristic algorithms during the optimization of dual-ion batteries appears to be particularly intriguing.

\emph{While the use of synthetic IV curves is mentioned, the process for generating
these curves could be elaborated upon.
Details such as the assumptions made, the variability in parameters used to generate the curves,
and how these synthetic models compare to actual solar cell data would greatly enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the results.}

In the first part of the study, the performance of meta--heuristic algorithms for parameter estimation was evaluated using a single \emph{IV} curve.
This curve represents the experimental data of bulk heterojunction photocells prepared
using a composite of $p$--DTS(FBTTh$_2$)$_2$ and neat C$_{70}$ \cite{Tada2015Organic}.
The information was added to the revised manuscript (page~4, paragraph~1).

In the second part, we simulated a set of \emph{IV} characteristics.
These curves correspond to the temperature range from 260~K to 350~K.
In the simulation process, we considered the temperature dependencies of the parameters.
We based our approach on known physical mechanisms of current flow in NG-SCs and
used the reported temperature dependencies of saturation current, ideality factor, shunt resistance, and series resistance.
However, the main focus was on achieving a diversity of parameter ratios rather
than attempting to precisely replicate real--life PV converters of a specific type.
Furthermore, an S--shaped \emph{IV} curve is observed in various types of solar cells,
and diverse charge transport mechanisms significantly complicate the selection of a single possible temperature dependence for each of the eight model parameters.
The specific temperature dependencies and parameter values utilized are detailed in Subsection~2.2.2.

The \emph{IV} curves ware simulated using Eqs.~(1)--(2) over a voltage range of 0-0.8~V (in â€˜â€˜Single--\emph{IV} caseâ€™â€™) or
0-1.0~V (in â€˜â€˜\emph{IV}--set caseâ€™â€™) with a 10~mV step.
The information was added to the revised manuscript (last paragraphs of Subsection~2.2.1 and Subsection~2.2.2).

\emph{The conclusion hints at future research into the impact of noisy data on algorithm performance.
It would strengthen the current study to include preliminary investigations or simulations on how noise influences the effectiveness of the meta-heuristic algorithms.
Even basic insights could provide significant value in understanding the robustness of these algorithms under practical conditions.}

\noindent
\textcolor[rgb]{0.51,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{Reply:}}
The results of some preliminary simulations on how noise influences the effectiveness of 
the meta-heuristic algorithm are presented in the Appendix~B of revised manuscript.

\emph{The paper mentions the use of nonparametric statistical methods but could include more comprehensive details about these analyses.
For instance, discussing why particular tests were chosen, the statistical significance levels,
 and the interpretation of these tests would help in understanding the comparative analysis more deeply.}

Wilcoxon test is used to assess whether there are statistically significant differences between pairs of algorithms.
Meanwhile, the Friedman, Friedman Aligned, and Quade tests are employed when it's necessary to compare three or more related groups of results (algorithms).
Friedman test evaluates whether there are statistically significant differences between the medians of the ranks of these algorithms.
Friedman Aligned Ranks test addresses the issue of rank correlation in the original Friedman test, providing more precise results.
Finally, the Quade test helps account for the effects of observed factors, such as random variations,
to more accurately determine the statistical differences between groups.

The main drawback of the Friedman, Friedman Aligned, and Quade tests is that
they can only detect significant differences over the whole set of multiple comparisons,
making it difficult to establish proper comparisons between specific algorithms \cite{Derrac2011}.
To address these issues, it is necessary to employ post-hoc procedures.
Post-hoc methods are applied after the initial analysis and allow for controlling the overall error rate
when comparing multiple algorithms, thereby reducing the likelihood of randomly identifying statistically significant differences.

$1\times N$ designs help determine if there are statistically significant differences between one algorithm
(the control algorithm) and each of the other algorithms.
Multidimensional comparisons $N\times N$ designs involve analyzing statistical differences between all possible pairs of algorithms.
Typically, different post-hoc procedures are used for $1\times N$ and $N\times N$ comparisons.
Description of all the used post-hoc procedures can be found in Derrac \emph{et al.} \cite{Derrac2011}.

All mentioned methods are standard for comparing metaheuristic algorithms \cite{Derrac2011}.
Their comprehensive application enables making the most well-founded conclusions.
In our case, only applying the entire set of tests and post--hoc methods
has enabled us to detect slight differences in the accuracy of model parameter evaluation by different algorithms.

In most cases, the study used the widely accepted significance level of 0.05.

\emph{ Adding visual representations such as scatter plots, error distributions,
or convergence graphs of the algorithms' performance over iterations could provide intuitive insights into their behavior.

The convergence graphs for  algorithms were added (see Fig.S1 in the supplementary materials).
Information about the existence of convergence graphs has been added to the revised manuscript (first paragraph in Subsection 3.1).

Besides the scatter plots for parameter determination results are represented in Figs.~S15-S22 (supplementary materials).
Information about the existence of scatter plots has been added to the revised manuscript (page~16, first paragraph in Subsection 3.3.2).

Simultaneously, the interquartile range (IQR) for estimated parameter values deals with error distributions.
IQR data is represented in Figs.~4, 9, and S6--S14.
Therefore, we believe that the separate error distribution graphs are somewhat redundant.

\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.50,1.00}{\textbf{Comment~6.}}
\emph{ the paper could discuss the practical implications of implementing these algorithms
in real-world solar cell testing and production environments.
Suggestions on how to integrate these algorithms into existing systems, the expected improvements
in parameter estimation accuracy, and potential challenges in deployment would be beneficial for practitioners in the field.}

When analyzing the significance of the results, it is essential to consider the following points.
The \emph{IV} characteristics are one of the key measurements  in the analysis
of solar cells in both research and industrial mass production.
Typically, \emph{IV} curves are analyzed using a specific model,
and the model parameters are closely related to the internal physical mechanisms acting within the solar cell.
Therefore, their efficient and sufficiently accurate extraction is important
as an analysis tool for understanding the processes involved.
Thus, the algorithms selected in our study can significantly aid in modeling NG-SCs,
aiming to enhance the understanding of their internal processes.
Specifically, this includes the underlying causes of the S--shaped kink
and the peculiarities of PV conversion in advanced solar cells, such as those employing phase--change materials \cite{Zhu2024,Zhu2023}.

Precise knowledge of the model parameter values is crucial for many practical applications.
For example, they are used in the simulation and emulation of PV systems,
for quality control of PV cells during manufacturing,
and in the study of SC degradation \cite{Chin2019}.
So, for a successful implementation of a PV system, the availability of an accurate,
fast, and reliable computer simulation tool is indispensable.
The algorithm for model parameter extraction can be a valuable tool for developing a
reliable computational engine for a PV simulator \cite{Chin2017}.
Diagnosing PV degradation can be achieved by monitoring and comparing the SC parameters with those in their initial states.
In this case, it is impossible to overstate the importance of the ability to parameter extraction with high precision.
Finally, optimization efforts and quantitative studies to assess the capabilities of a particular technology greatly benefit from the correct extraction of the model parameters under various test conditions \cite{OrtizConde2006}.
Implementing selected algorithms in real-world solar cell testing and production environments allows for
enhanced characterization precision (due to precise determination of model parameters),
production process optimization (more accurate SC characterization leads to minimizing defects and increasing efficiency),
quality improvement (the algorithm helps identify shortcomings at early production stages,
thereby enhancing overall product quality),
testing acceleration (the automated model parameter determination can shorten the time
required for testing each element, enabling increased production volumes),
and cost reduction (optimizing the testing process and reducing the number of defective elements decreases production costs).
Moreover, potential challenges in deployment are minimal, given the algorithms'
low resource requirements and compatibility with modern computers.
There is no need for personnel training, as understanding the intricacies of the algorithms is unnecessary for their use.
Additionally, constant maintenance, updates, and bug fixes are not required.
The only requirements for implementation involve developing software interfaces to integrate the new algorithms with existing control and monitoring systems and ensuring the market's readiness to adapt established processes to these changes.

The information was added to the revised manuscript (page~17 and 18, last two  paragraph before Conclusion).

Unfortunately, we cannot offer insights into expected improvements in parameter estimation accuracy 
because, to our knowledge, 
the studies dedicated to examining the accuracy of parameter determination from S-shaped current-voltage curves are currently absent.
