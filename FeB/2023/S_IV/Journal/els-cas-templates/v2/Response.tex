\emph{The paper would benefit from more detailed descriptions of the individual meta-heuristic algorithms used,
especially the lesser-known STLBO and ADELI.
Explaining their mechanisms, strengths, and why they are particularly suited to solving the parameter estimation problem
for S-shaped IV curves would help readers understand their effective application in this
context added recent LR}

More detailed descriptions of the STLBO and ADELI algorithms were added.

We would also like to express our gratitude to the Reviewer for providing exceptionally insightful references. 
We hope the Reviewer will not object to their inclusion in the revised manuscript (references 1, 2, 3).

Additionally, the idea of employing meta-heuristic algorithms during the optimization of dual-ion batteries appears to be particularly intriguing.

\emph{While the use of synthetic IV curves is mentioned, the process for generating
these curves could be elaborated upon.
Details such as the assumptions made, the variability in parameters used to generate the curves,
and how these synthetic models compare to actual solar cell data would greatly enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the results.}

\emph{The conclusion hints at future research into the impact of noisy data on algorithm performance.
It would strengthen the current study to include preliminary investigations or simulations on how noise influences the effectiveness of the meta-heuristic algorithms.
Even basic insights could provide significant value in understanding the robustness of these algorithms under practical conditions.}

\emph{The paper mentions the use of nonparametric statistical methods but could include more comprehensive details about these analyses.
For instance, discussing why particular tests were chosen, the statistical significance levels,
 and the interpretation of these tests would help in understanding the comparative analysis more deeply.}

\emph{ Adding visual representations such as scatter plots, error distributions,
or convergence graphs of the algorithms' performance over iterations could provide intuitive insights into their behavior.
This would also help in visually comparing the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithms beyond the tabular or textual data presented.}

The text was revised.
the text was revised (page~5, column~1, paragraph~2).

The ``relative deformation'' was meant.
The term ``strain'' is used in the revised version.
