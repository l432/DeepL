abstract = {A novel low-cost aluminum–graphite dual-ion battery is reported. The battery shows a reversible capacity of ≈100 mAh g−1 and a capacity retention of 88\% after 200 charge–discharge cycles. A packaged aluminum–graphite battery is estimated to deliver an energy density of ≈150 Wh kg−1 at a power density of ≈1200 W kg−1, which is ≈50\% higher than most commercial lithium ion batteries.},
