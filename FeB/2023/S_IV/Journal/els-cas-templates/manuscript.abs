Defect-assisted recombination processes frequently
limit the photovoltaic device performance.
The low-cost and express methods of impurity contamination control
are in demand at solar cell manufacturing.
In this paper, we applied deep learning-based
approach to extract the iron concentration in silicon solar cell from an
ideality factor values.
