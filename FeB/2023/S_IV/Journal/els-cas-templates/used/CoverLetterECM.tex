Dear Editors,

%Enclosed is a manuscript entitled “XXX XXXX XXXXX” by sb, which we are submitting for publication in the journal of …. We have chosen this journal because it deals with …
Enclosed with this letter you will find the electronic submission of manuscript entitled
``Estimation of parameters for solar cells with S--shaped current--voltage characteristics using meta--heuristic algorithms'' O.~Olikh.



This is an original paper which has not been simultaneously submitted as a whole or in part anywhere else.
No conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript.


It is well known that identifying the parameters of photovoltaic (PV) models based on measured current-voltage (IV) characteristic curves
is crucial for simulating, evaluating, and controlling PV systems.
IV characteristics of new-generation PV devices, 
including thin-film, organic, perovskite, and quantum dot solar cells, often demonstrate an S-shaped deformation.
Hence, accurately estimating parameters from S-shaped IV curves is of utmost importance.
No Free Lunch theory states that no single meta--heuristic algorithm can solve all optimization tasks effectively.
This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of parameter estimation according to the opposed two-diode model 
using a set of 14 meta-heuristic algorithms and determine the best-performing among them.
The obtained results are compared using various nonparametric statistical methods.
We believe that this work of testing and comparative analysis of different meta-heuristic algorithms for the estimation of solar cell parameters
would be of interest to the readers.


We would  very much appreciate if you would consider the manuscript for publication in the \emph{Energy Conversion and Management}.
%We appreciate your consideration of our manuscript, and we look forward to receiving comments from the reviewers.
