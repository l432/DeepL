%Enclosed is a manuscript entitled “XXX XXXX XXXXX” by sb, which we are submitting for publication in the journal of …. We have chosen this journal because it deals with …
Enclosed with this letter you will find the electronic submission of manuscript entitled
``A test of meta-heuristic algorithms for parameter extraction of next-generation solar cells with S-shaped current-voltage curves'' O.~Olikh.



It is well known that identifying the parameters of photovoltaic (PV) models based on measured current-voltage (IV) characteristic curves
is crucial for simulating, evaluating, and controlling PV systems.
IV characteristics of new-generation PV devices,
including thin-film, organic, perovskite, and quantum dot solar cells, often demonstrate an S-shaped deformation.
Hence, accurately estimating parameters from S-shaped IV curves is of utmost importance.
No Free Lunch theory states that no single meta--heuristic algorithm can solve all optimization tasks effectively.
This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of parameter estimation according to the opposed two-diode model
using a set of 14 meta-heuristic algorithms and determine the best-performing among them.
The obtained results are compared using various nonparametric statistical methods.
We believe that this work of testing and comparative analysis of different meta-heuristic algorithms for the estimation of solar cell parameters
would be of interest to the readers.


This is an original paper which has not been simultaneously submitted as a whole or in part anywhere else.
No elements of the work have been published in any form.
No conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript.
