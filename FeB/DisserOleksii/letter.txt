machine learning for defect parameters


Dear Dr.Yoann Buratti,

My name is Oleg Olikh. I am proffesor of Physics Faculty, Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Ukraine (https://gen.phys.univ.kiev.ua/280-olikh/, https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=6506623724).

I am interested in using machine learning in defect parameters evaluation
(https://doi.org/10.1109/KhPIWeek57572.2022.9916328, https://doi.org/10.1002/pip.3539).
I read your paper "Deep Learning Extraction of the Temperature-Dependent Parameters of Bulk Defects" (https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c12162) with great interest. Thank you for the citation: it allowed me to find your paper quickly. 
I was especially impressed by using of convolutional neural networks.
I think it is very promising to fine-tune vision models, which previously leaned on massive datasets.

I have one request and question. The request deals with a plugin for the conversion of data files (CSV format, three columns, or matrix with numbers) into images. In your paper, the numbers were temperature, excess carrier concentration, and lifetime values. Can you advise about a similar plugin for automatic converting? The hand conversion of thousand images is very waste of time; in the case of a hundred thousand, it is unreal.

The question deals with the CNN application. CNN was used for classification only in your paper. But the output layer of the vision model consists of numbers (probability of image type). Have you tried using this array of numbers as an input layer for a regression model that can predict the defect parameter value (Et value, for instance)?

I hope for your help with the conversion plugin.

With my best regards,
 
Oleg
