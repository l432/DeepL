# this is an example file containing optical capture data, to be used in SCAPS for IPV calculations
#
# the first column contains the wavelenght of incoming light in nm
# the second column contains the optical capture cross section of one defect in m^2
# for wavelengths outside the specified interval, the optical capture cross section is taken as zero
#
# lambda[nm]  sigma[m^2]
