AQ4: "AUTHOR: Please provide a suitable figure (abstract diagram or illustration selected from the manuscript or an additional eye-catching' figure) and a short ‘GTOC’ abstract (maximum 80 words or 3 sentences) summarizing the key findings presented in the paper for Table of Content (TOC) entry."


GTOC abstract:
"The deep learning‐based approach was applied for estimating iron concentration in silicon solar cells by using ideality factor. The simulation of solar cells with the back surface field design for generating labeled training and test datasets was performed using SCAPS‐1D software. The results for both synthetic and experimental data demonstrate that deep neural networks can predict iron concentration using the ideality factor, temperature, base‐thickness, and doping level of solar cells."
