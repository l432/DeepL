\begin{abstract}
Defect-assisted recombination processes frequently
limit the photovoltaic device performance.
Non--destructive methods of evaluation of the impurities contamination in solar cells, are important from an applied point of view.
In this work, we use numerical device
simulation to  demonstrate the ability to extract impurity contamination
from an ideality factor value and utilizing a deep neural network (DNN).
The dense layer DNN was trained by using simulation of current-voltage curves
of silicon \emph{n}\textsuperscript{+}--\emph{p}--\emph{p}\textsuperscript{+}  structure with the following parameters.
The iron  concentration ranged from 10\textsuperscript{10} to 10\textsuperscript{13}~cm\textsuperscript{-3},
the base doping level --- from 10\textsuperscript{15} to 10\textsuperscript{17}~cm\textsuperscript{-3},
the base thickness --- from 150 to 240~micron,
and the temperature --- from 290 to 340~K.
The structure with interstitial iron atoms only as well as with coexistence of Fe\textsubscript{i}B\textsubscript{s} pairs and Fe\textsubscript{i} was under consideration.
It is shown that DNN is able to predict iron concentration with mean squared relative error up to 0.03.

\section{Introduction}

%IronSC
%\citet{Fortunato2010}.

Metal  contamination control remains an important challenge for silicon processing both for microelectronics, logic technologies and solar cells (SCs) \citep{Claers2018,ZHU2016192,FeB:Schmidt,IronSC}.
%Metallic contamination leads to recombination defect creation and is a performance-limiting factor in many photovoltaic (PV) devices .
%Techniques to monitor impurities are an essential part of successful yield engineering and processing.
Typically, metal related defect characterization is performed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy,
electron-paramagnetic resonance,
minority carrier lifetime measurements,
deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS),
Laplace DLTS etc \citep{Schroder2006,HowMuchPhysics,LaplDLTS}.
However, these techniques are time-consuming, require special equipment or/and sample preparing.
At the same time, the current-voltage (IV) measurement is a  standard  rapid industrial SC characterization technique.
IV characteristics contain important information about electrically active defects \citep{HowMuchPhysics,BulyarJAP}.
And a few  defect diagnostics by IV characteristics are proposed
\citep{HowMuchPhysics,BulyarJAP,BulyarSSE,Claeys2019,simoen2007}.
The temperature dependencies of current components \citep{Claeys2019,simoen2007}
or IV differential parameters \citep{BulyarJAP,BulyarSSE} are under consideration.
But the numerous and high accuracy IV measurements are required in the first and second cases, respectively.


In our previous work \citep{Olikh2019SM}, we have shown that the SC ideality factor value ($n$) can be used to estimate the iron concentration ($N_{\mathrm{Fe}}$).
It should be noted that the ideality factor is quite often  used to characterize the various
semiconductor barrier structures \cite{Heide,Duan,n_CharGaN,n_CharSemic,n_CharPhysRevAppl}.
However, a defect's signature in an ideality factor is convoluted with those from so many other physical processes.
As a result the obtained analytic expressions $N_{\mathrm{Fe}}=f(n)$ are not general and the numerous grading curves are needed to $N_{\mathrm{Fe}}$ determination \citep{Olikh2019SM}.
On the other hand, in the last decade, the deep learning, which is enable to solve problems without clear algorithmization, have been successfully used in various fields of theoretical and applied physics \cite{MachLean_RevModPhys,MachLeanJAP,MachLeanPPV}.
Furthermore, materials informatics
(combination of material property calculations/measurements and informatics algorithms)
has been asserted \cite{MI_JAP} to become the fourth (along with theory, simulations, and experiments) paradigm of science.
The aim of this work is to apply the deep learning approach for predicting the iron concentration from ideality factor
(so to say "deep learning for deep levels").
Further, unlike in previous work \citep{Olikh2019SM}, the back surface field (BSF) $n^+$--$p$--$p^+$ structure was under consideration
and the base thickness influence on ideality factor was taken into account as well.

As the approximation to the practical using, the paper considers a fairly simple system
which consists of crystalline silicon (c-Si) SC  and iron impurity.
However, the system is important in practice.
Silicon solar cells constitute ~90\% of current global production capacity \citep{SCRev2015} and
BSF  is one of  popular designs used for industrial mass production of c-Si SCs \citep{SCRev2020}.
Iron is a major as one of the most detrimental metal impurities in c-Si SCs \citep{ZHU2016192,FeB:Schmidt,IronSC}.
The flowchart of the used heuristic approach is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_chem}.
The following milestones can be distinguished.
First, the dark IV characteristic is simulated for SCs with both known contaminant composition and various parameters.
In our numerical simulation we make use of SCAPS-1D \citep{SCAPS1,SCAPS2},
which widely used to model silicon-based devices \citep{SCAPSuseSi4,SCAPSuseSi1,SCAPSuseSi6}.
Second, the obtained characteristic is fitted according to the double-diode model and the ideality factor is estimated.
As a result of aforesaid steps, the labeled datasets were produced.
Obviously, the labeled dataset from experimental IVs  would be preferable,
but it is practically difficult to find the thousands of samples with the required parameters.
Third, the training of deep neural network (DNN) to estimate an iron contamination  by using SC's base thickness, doping level,
temperature, and ideality factor value.
Fours, the DNN testing.

\section{Simulation Details}

The presented calculation uses $n^+$--$p$--$p^+$ structure.
$n^+$ is the emitter layer with the donor concentration $N_D=10^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ and
the thickness 0.5~$\mu$m.
$p$ and $p^+$ are the base and BSF-layer, respectively, which are uniformly doped with boron.
$1$~$\mu$m and $5\times10^{18}$~cm$^{-3}$ are the thickness $d_{BSF}$ and the acceptor concentration $N_{BSF}$
of the $p^+$ layer.
The base with the thickness $d_p=150$--$240$~$\mu$m is doped with concentration
$N_\mathrm{B}=10^{15}$--$10^{17}$~cm$^{-3}$.

The simulations  were carried out over the temperature range $290-340$~K.
The SCAPS setting file was created for each temperature using the following material parameters.
The bandgap $E_G$ and bandgap narrowing $\Delta E_G$ models are, respectively, from P\"{a}ssler \citep{Pasler} and Yan and Cuevas \citep{EgNarrow}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqEg}
E_G=E_{G0}-\alpha\Theta\left\{\frac{1-3\Delta^2}{e^{\frac{\Theta}{T}}-1}
    +\frac{3\Delta^2}{2}\left(\sqrt[6]{1+\frac{\pi^2}{3(1+\Delta^2)}\left(\frac{2T}{\Theta}\right)^2
    +\frac{3\Delta^2-1}{4}\left(\frac{2T}{\Theta}\right)^3+\frac{8}{3}\left(\frac{2T}{\Theta}\right)^4
    +\left(\frac{2T}{\Theta}\right)^6}-1\right)\right\}\,,\\
\Delta E_G=4.20\times10^{-5}\left[\ln\left(\frac{N_{D}}{10^{14}}\right)\right]^3\,;\qquad
     \Delta E_G=4.72\times10^{-5}\left[\ln\left(\frac{N_{B,BSF}}{10^{14}}\right)\right]^3\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where
$E_{G0}=1.1701$~eV,
$\alpha=3.23\times10^{-4}$~eV/K,
$\Theta=446$~K,
$\Delta=0.51$.
The carrier thermal velocities are calculated from models by Green \citep{Nc:Green}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqVth}
    \upsilon_{\mathrm{th},n}=\sqrt{\frac{8qkT}{0.28m_0\pi}}\,;\qquad
    \upsilon_{\mathrm{th},p}=\sqrt{\frac{8qkT}{0.41m_0\pi}}\,,
\end{equation}
where
$m_0$ is the free electron mass.
The effective states density masses in the conduction band $m^*_{dC}$ and
the valence band $m^*_{dV}$ are calculated according to models from Couderc et al. \citep{Si_ni_Couderc}:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \left(\frac{m^*_{dC}}{m_0}\right)^{1.5} &=& 1.094-1.312\times10^{-5}T+6.753\times10^{-7}T^2+4.609\times10^{-10}T^3\,, \\
  \left(\frac{m^*_{dV}}{m_0}\right)^{1.5} &=& 0.3426+3.376\times10^{-3}T-4.689\times10^{-6}T^2+2.525\times10^{-9}T^3\,.
\end{eqnarray}
The carrier mobilities and the free carrier effective masses are from Klaassen \citep{KLAASSEN953}
and O'Mara et al. \citep{OMara}, respectively.
The temperature and doping dependencies of Auger recombination coefficients are calculated from models by Altermatt et al. \citep{Si_Auger}:
\begin{eqnarray}
% \nonumber to remove numbering (before each equation)
   \nonumber C_{p} (T)&=& (7.91\times10^{-32}-4.13\times10^{-35}T+3.59\times10^{-37}T^2)\\
  &&\times\left(1+\left(564812T^{-1.6545}-1\right)\left(1-\tanh\left[\left\{\frac{p}{5\times10^{16}}\right\}^{0.29}\right]\right)\right)\,, \\
   C_{n} (T)&=& 2.8\times10^{-31}
  \times\left(1+\left(235548T^{-1.5013}-1\right)\left(1-\tanh\left[\left\{\frac{n}{5\times10^{16}}\right\}^{0.34}\right]\right)\right)\,.
\end{eqnarray}
The Auger recombination coefficient is from Nguyen et al. \citep{Si_BtB}.

The outside surface recombination with electron and hole velocities $10^3$~cm/s was taken into account.

The simulations are carried out under the assumption that the defect--assisted recombination is connected with iron--related deep levels only.
As the base and the SBF-layer uniform contaminant, iron is assumed to be in concentration
$N_{\mathrm{Fe}}=10^{10}$--$10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$.
The simulations have been performed for the following two cases.
In the first one, the concentration of totally dissolved iron is given by a sum of
the concentration of the interstitial iron $\mathrm{Fe}_i$
and the concentration of trigonal iron-boron pair $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$:
\begin{equation}\label{eqNFeB}
  N_{\mathrm{Fe}}=N_{\mathrm{Fe}_i}+N_{\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s}\,.
\end{equation}
The defect distributions are uniform, depend on the Fermi level $F$ position, and are given by
\citep{MurphyJAP2011,FeB:kinetic}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqNFeB}
    \frac{N_{\mathrm{FeB}}}{N_{\mathrm{Fe}}}=\frac{N_\mathrm{B}10^{-23}\exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{kT}\right)}
     {\left[1+\frac{N_\mathrm{B}}{10^{23}}\exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{kT}\right)\right]\left[1+\exp\left(-\frac{F-E_{\mathrm{Fe}_i}}{kT}\right)\right]}\,,
     \quad N_{\mathrm{Fe}_i}=N_{\mathrm{Fe}}-N_{\mathrm{FeB}}\,,
\end{equation}
where
$E_b=0.582$~eV is the binding energy of the $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$ pairs,
$E_{\mathrm{Fe}_i}$ is the donor level, associated with $\mathrm{Fe}_i$.
This case correspond to the equilibrium condition and is labeled ``Fe-FeB'' from now on.

In the second one, the $\mathrm{Fe}_i$ is suggested to be only present with uniform distribution ($N_{\mathrm{Fe}_i}=N_{\mathrm{Fe}}$).
This case can be realized by heat treatment (210$^\circ$C, 3~min) \cite{FeB_Zong} or intense illumination \cite{FeBLight2} and is referred as ``Fe-FeB'' hereafter.


The donor level $E_{\mathrm{Fe}_i} = E_V+0.394$~eV
with electron $\sigma_{n,{\mathrm{Fe}}}=3.47\times10^{-11}T^{-1.48}$~cm$^2$ and
hole $\sigma_{p,{\mathrm{Fe}}}=4.54\times10^{-16}\exp\left(-\frac{0.05}{kT}\right)$~cm$^2$ capture cross-sections \cite{MurphyJAP2011,ROUGIEUX2018}
is associated with $\mathrm{Fe}_i$ in simulations.
The donor level $E_{\mathrm{FeB}}^\mathrm{D}= E_V+0.10$~eV,
$\sigma_{n,{\mathrm{FeB}}}^\mathrm{D}=4\times10^{-13}$~cm$^2$,
$\sigma_{p,{\mathrm{FeB}}}^\mathrm{D}=2\times10^{-14}$~cm$^2$
and acceptor level $E_{\mathrm{FeB}}^\mathrm{A}= E_C-0.26$~eV,
$\sigma_{n,{\mathrm{FeB}}}^\mathrm{A}=5.1\times10^{-9}T^{-2.5}$~cm$^2$,
$\sigma_{p,{\mathrm{FeB}}}^\mathrm{A}=3.32\times10^{-10}\exp\left(-\frac{0.262}{kT}\right)$~cm$^2$
\cite{Istratov1999,MurphyJAP2011,ROUGIEUX2018}
are used for $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$.

The dark forward IV characteristic were generated by SCAPS over a voltage range up to $0.45$~V.
According to the two-diode model, the dark SC current is given by \citep{Breitenstein2013}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqIVd}
    I=I_{01}\left[\exp\left(-\frac{q(V-R_sI)}{kT}\right)-1\right]
      + I_{02}\left[\exp\left(-\frac{q(V-R_sI)}{nkT}\right)-1\right]
      +\frac{V-R_sI}{R_{sh}}\,,
\end{equation}
where
$I_{01}$ and $I_{02}$ are the saturation currents,
$R_{sh}$ and $R_s$ are the shunt and series resistances.
The two-diode model are often used to describe real Si SCs
and we used Eq.~\ref{eqIVd} to fit the simulated data by taking $n$, $I_{01}$, $I_{02}$,
$R_{sh}$, and $R_s$ as fitting parameters.
The fitting was performed by using the meta--heuristic method IJAVA \cite{IJAVA}.
It should be noted that influence of both $R_s$ (obtained values $<10^{-2}$~$\Omega$) and $R_{sh}$
(obtained values $>10^{18}$~$\Omega$) can be neglected in simulated IV.

It is the ideality factor value $n$ which is used in our further calculation.
The ideality factors, which are obtained in  Fe-case and Fe-FeB-case,
are referred as  $n_\mathrm{Fe}$ and $n_\mathrm{Fe-FeB}$ hereafter.
The typical simulated dependencies of  the ideality factor are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_nValues}.
The detailed discussion about $n_\mathrm{Fe}$ and $n_\mathrm{Fe-FeB}$  values are presented elsewhere \cite{OlikhJPS},
however it should be noted that
(i)~$n$ can takes equal values for different SC parameters values;
(ii)~dependencies of $n_\mathrm{Fe}$ and $n_\mathrm{Fe-FeB}$ varies slightly.

\section{Deep neural network models}

Training a deep neural network requires a large number of samples.
In order to build a training dataset, we used IV characteristics, which
are simulated by using 4 $d_p$ values, 9 $N_\mathrm{B}$ values, 11 $T$ values and 19 $N_{\mathrm{Fe}}$ values.
These base thickness, doping level, temperature, and iron concentration values are regularly (for $T$ and $d_p$ in linear scale, for $N_{\mathrm{Fe}}$ and $N_\mathrm{B}$ in logarithmic scale) distributed over the  ranges $150$--$240$~$\mu$m, $10^{15}$--$10^{17}$~cm$^{-3}$, $290-340$~K, and
$10^{10}$--$10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$, respectively.
Thus, 7524 IV characteristics are simulated in Fe-case as well as in Fe-FeB-case to to build a training dataset.

Besides, several test datasets are prepared.
The $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, and $N_{\mathrm{Fe}}$ values, which equal to  values from training dataset, and $T$ values, which is divergent from training dataset, are used to build the test dataset, labeled ``T-varied''.
These dataset is based on 894 pairs of IV characteristics.
The similar approach was used to prepare ``d-varied'' (1189 samples), ``Fe-varied'' (856 samples), and ``B-varied'' (514 samples) test datasets.
The base thickness, doping level, temperature, and iron concentration values, which are divergent from training dataset values, are used to prepare ``All-varied'' (684 samples).

The precise parameters values are listed in  Supplementary Material.

We have tried to construct the DNN, which is able to estimate iron contamination by using
SC parameters ($d_p$ and $N_\mathrm{B}$),  measurement temperature, and result of IV fitting (ideality factor value).
As it is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_chem} two DNNs with different input parameters were under consideration.
The input sample of the first one consist of $\{d_p,\log N_\mathrm{B},T,n_\mathrm{Fe-FeB}\}$.
In practice, these input set can be obtained from one dark IV measurement.
These neural network referred as DNN$_\mathrm{FeFeB}$ hereafter.
The second one uses  $\{d_p,\log N_\mathrm{B},T,n_\mathrm{Fe-FeB},n_\mathrm{Fe}\}$ in input layer.
In practice, the obtaining of such a set requires additional SC processing (e.g. intense illumination) and two IV measuring.
The label  DNN$_\mathrm{FeFeB-Fe}$ is used below.

The dense deep neural network was implemented through the high-level Keras API provided by TensorFlow.
The input layers consist of 4 (5) nodes --- see Fig.~\ref{fig_chem}.
1 node and linear activation were used in output layer.
The five configurations oh hidden layers were under consideration:
(i)~``pipe'': each hidden layer contains equal number of nodes;
(ii)~``trapezium'': six hidden layers, number of neural linearly decreases from 100~\% (first layer) to 50~\%(last layer);
(iii)~``triangle'': ten layers, number of neural linearly decreases from 100~\% (first layer) to 10~\%(last layer);
(iv)~``butterfly'': two serial reflected trapezium configuration;
(v)~``fir'': two serial trapezium configuration.

The loss function was chosen mean square relative error (MSRE):
\begin{equation}
\label{eqMSRE}
    \mathrm{MSRE}=\frac{1}{N_s}\sum_{i=1}^{N_s}\frac{(N_\mathrm{Fe,TRUE,i}-N_\mathrm{Fe,PRED,i})^2}{N_\mathrm{Fe,TRUE,i}\cdot N_\mathrm{Fe,PRED,i}}\,,
\end{equation}
where
$N_s$ is the number of samples in dataset,
$N_\mathrm{Fe,TRUE,i}$ is the iron concentration, which was used in simulation of $i$--th sample,
$N_\mathrm{Fe,PRED,i}$ is the DNN prediction for $i$--th sample.

Hyperparameters include the number of nodes for first hidden layer,
the number of hidden layers (in pipe configuration),
the batch size,
the activation function,
the optimizer,
the learning rate,
the preprocessing method,
the dropout rate,
the regularization function,
the regularization rate,
and the weight initializer.
A grid search (coarse tuning) and Bayesian search (fine tuning) were performed over the predefined hyperparameter space, shown in Table~\ref{tabHP}, and the best hyperparameter combination is chosen.

\begin{table}[width=.9\linewidth,cols=2,pos=h]

\end{table}

10--fold cross--validation was used to estimate DNN training.
The MSRE, determination coefficient $R^2$, and correlation coefficient $R$ were 
three metrics used to evaluate the performance of the DNN models on test datasets.

As a result of aforesaid steps, the labeled datasets were produced.

The Elsevier cas-sc class is based on the
standard article class and supports almost all of the functionality of
that class. In addition, it features commands and options to format the
\begin{itemize} \item document style \item baselineskip \item front
matter \item keywords and MSC codes \item theorems, definitions and
proofs \item lables of enumerations \item citation style and labeling.
\end{itemize}

This class depends on the following packages
for its proper functioning:

\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep=0pt
\item {natbib.sty} for citation processing;
\item {geometry.sty} for margin settings;
\item {fleqn.clo} for left aligned equations;
\item {graphicx.sty} for graphics inclusion;
\item {hyperref.sty} optional packages if hyperlinking is
  required in the document;
\end{enumerate}

All the above packages are part of any
standard \LaTeX{} installation.
Therefore, the users need not be
bothered about downloading any extra packages.

\section{Installation}

The package is available at author resources page at Elsevier
(\url{http://www.elsevier.com/locate/latex}).
The class may be moved or copied to a place, usually,
\verb+$TEXMF/tex/latex/elsevier/+, %$%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
or a folder which will be read
by \LaTeX{} during document compilation.  The \TeX{} file
database needs updation after moving/copying class file.  Usually,
we use commands like \verb+mktexlsr+ or \verb+texhash+ depending
upon the distribution and operating system.

\section{Front matter}

The author names and affiliations could be formatted in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item Group the authors per affiliation.
\item Use footnotes to indicate the affiliations.
\end{enumerate}
See the front matter of this document for examples.
You are recommended to conform your choice to the journal you
are submitting to.

\section{Bibliography styles}

There are various bibliography styles available. You can select the
style of your choice in the preamble of this document. These styles are
Elsevier styles based on standard styles like Harvard and Vancouver.
Please use Bib\TeX\ to generate your bibliography and include DOIs
whenever available.

%Here are two sample references:
%See \citet{Fortunato2010}. Also refer \citet{Fortunato2010,NewmanGirvan2004}.
%More citations are here \citep{Fortunato2010,Vehlowetal2013}.

\section{Floats}
{Figures} may be included using the command, \verb+\includegraphics+ in
combination with or without its several options to further control
graphic. \verb+\includegraphics+ is provided by {graphic[s,x].sty}
which is part of any standard \LaTeX{} distribution.
{graphicx.sty} is loaded by default. \LaTeX{} accepts figures in
the postscript format while pdf\LaTeX{} accepts {*.pdf},
{*.mps} (metapost), {*.jpg} and {*.png} formats.
pdf\LaTeX{} does not accept graphic files in the postscript format.

%	r=0$, See also Table \protect\ref{tbl1}).}

The \verb+table+ environment is handy for marking up tabular
material. If users want to use {multirow.sty},
{array.sty}, etc., to fine control/enhance the tables, they
are welcome to load any package of their choice and
{cas-sc.cls} will work in combination with all loaded
packages.

\begin{table}[width=.9\linewidth,cols=4,pos=h]
\caption{This is a test caption. This is a test caption. This is a test
caption. This is a test caption.}\label{tbl1}
\begin{tabular*}{\tblwidth}{@{} LLLL@{} }
\toprule
Col 1 & Col 2 & Col 3 & Col4\\
\midrule
12345 & 12345 & 123 & 12345 \\
12345 & 12345 & 123 & 12345 \\
12345 & 12345 & 123 & 12345 \\
12345 & 12345 & 123 & 12345 \\
12345 & 12345 & 123 & 12345 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular*}
\end{table}

\section[Theorem and ...]{Theorem and theorem like environments}

{cas-sc.cls} provides a few shortcuts to format theorems and
theorem-like environments with ease. In all commands the options that
are used with the \verb+\newtheorem+ command will work exactly in the same
manner. {cas-sc.cls} provides three commands to format theorem or
theorem-like environments:

\begin{verbatim}
 \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
 \newtheorem{lemma}[theorem]{Lemma}
 \newdefinition{rmk}{Remark}
 \newproof{pf}{Proof}
 \newproof{pot}{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm2}}
\end{verbatim}


The \verb+\newtheorem+ command formats a
theorem in \LaTeX's default style with italicized font, bold font
for theorem heading and theorem number at the right hand side of the
theorem heading.  It also optionally accepts an argument which
will be printed as an extra heading in parentheses.

\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{theorem}
   For system (8), consensus can be achieved with
   $\|T_{\omega z}$ ...
     \begin{eqnarray}\label{10}
     ....
     \end{eqnarray}
  \end{theorem}
\end{verbatim}

\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}

\begin{theorem}
For system (8), consensus can be achieved with
$\|T_{\omega z}$ ...
\begin{eqnarray}\label{10}
....
\end{eqnarray}
\end{theorem}

The \verb+\newdefinition+ command is the same in
all respects as its \verb+\newtheorem+ counterpart except that
the font shape is roman instead of italic.  Both
\verb+\newdefinition+ and \verb+\newtheorem+ commands
automatically define counters for the environments defined.

The \verb+\newproof+ command defines proof environments with
upright font shape.  No counters are defined.


\section[Enumerated ...]{Enumerated and Itemized Lists}
{cas-sc.cls} provides an extended list processing macros
which makes the usage a bit more user friendly than the default
\LaTeX{} list macros.   With an optional argument to the
\verb+\begin{enumerate}+ command, you can change the list counter
type and its attributes.

\begin{verbatim}
 \begin{enumerate}[1.]
 \item The enumerate environment starts with an optional
   argument `1.', so that the item counter will be suffixed
   by a period.
 \item You can use `a)' for alphabetical counter and '(i)' for
   roman counter.
  \begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item Another level of list with alphabetical counter.
    \item One more item before we start another.
    \item One more item before we start another.
    \item One more item before we start another.
    \item One more item before we start another.
\end{verbatim}

Further, the enhanced list environment allows one to prefix a
string like `step' to all the item numbers.

%\pagebreak
\begin{verbatim}
 \begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
  \item This is the first step of the example list.
  \item Obviously this is the second step.
  \item The final step to wind up this example.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Cross-references}
In electronic publications, articles may be internally
hyperlinked. Hyperlinks are generated from proper
cross-references in the article.  For example, the words
\textcolor{black!80}{Fig.~1} will never be more than simple text,
whereas the proper cross-reference \verb+\ref{tiger}+ may be
turned into a hyperlink to the figure itself:
\textcolor{blue}{Fig.~1}.  In the same way,
the words \textcolor{blue}{Ref.~[1]} will fail to turn into a
hyperlink; the proper cross-reference is \verb+\cite{Knuth96}+.
Cross-referencing is possible in \LaTeX{} for sections,
subsections, formulae, figures, tables, and literature
references.

\section{Bibliography}

Two bibliographic style files (\verb+*.bst+) are provided ---
{model1-num-names.bst} and {model2-names.bst} --- the first one can be
used for the numbered scheme. This can also be used for the numbered
with new options of {natbib.sty}. The second one is for the author year
scheme. When  you use model2-names.bst, the citation commands will be
like \verb+\citep+,  \verb+\citet+, \verb+\citealt+ etc. However when
you use model1-num-names.bst, you may use only \verb+\cite+ command.

\verb+thebibliography+ environment.  Each reference is a
\verb+\bibitem+ and each \verb+\bibitem+ is identified by a label,
by which it can be cited in the text:

\noindent In connection with cross-referencing and
possible future hyperlinking it is not a good idea to collect
more that one literature item in one \verb+\bibitem+.  The
so-called Harvard or author-year style of referencing is enabled
by the \LaTeX{} package {natbib}. With this package the
literature can be cited as follows:


\begin{enumerate}[\textbullet]
\item Parenthetical: \verb+\citep{WB96}+ produces (Wettig \& Brown, 1996).
\item Textual: \verb+\citet{ESG96}+ produces Elson et al. (1996).
\item An affix and part of a reference:
\verb+\citep[e.g.][Ch. 2]{Gea97}+ produces (e.g. Governato et
al., 1997, Ch. 2).
\end{enumerate}

In the numbered scheme of citation, \verb+\cite{<label>}+ is used,
since \verb+\citep+ or \verb+\citet+ has no relevance in the numbered
scheme.  {natbib} package is loaded by {cas-sc} with
\verb+numbers+ as default option.  You can change this to author-year
or harvard scheme by adding option \verb+authoryear+ in the class
loading command.  If you want to use more options of the {natbib}
package, you can do so with the \verb+\biboptions+ command.  For
details of various options of the {natbib} package, please take a
look at the {natbib} documentation, which is part of any standard
\LaTeX{} installation.

\appendix
\section{My Appendix}
Appendix sections are coded under \verb+\appendix+.

\verb+\printcredits+ command is used after appendix sections to list
author credit taxonomy contribution roles tagged using \verb+\credit+
in frontmatter.
