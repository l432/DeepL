Two hidden layers with 2560 nodes per layer and six output nodes were selected. The activation function was chosen to be Sigmoid. The learning rate was kept at 0.2. 

labeled dataset to train on.

Training a deep neural network requires a large number of
samples. In order to build a dataset containing the correspondence
between S parameters, permittivity and permeability, we used CST
MICROWAVE STUDIO (MWS) to generate simulation data.

In order to make full use of the
sequence information of the data, we use a gated recurrent unit
(GRU) neural network17
to establish an retrieval model. Finally, we
train the network model with the generated samples, and the
trained model can automatically retrieve the permittivity and per-
meability by entering S parameters.


In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based electro-
magnetic parameter retrieval method that can solve the permittivity
and permeability based on the S parameters. This is the first
attempt to use deep learning for electromagnetic parameter
retrieval. The simulation shows that the proposed scheme has high
accuracy and does not have the multivaluedness problem of the tra-
ditional NRW method. It provides a novel, simple, and more uni-
versal approach for the retrieval method.



In order to train an ANN, a training set must be
provided.
