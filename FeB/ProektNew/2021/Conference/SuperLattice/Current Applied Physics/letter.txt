Dear Editors,


I have submitted an article on May 24.
Since then, the status of the article has not changed
("Submitted to Journal").
Did I make some mistake in the procedure? 
The article was transfered from "Superlattices and Microstructures" and I had no such experience.

Article: "Deep neural network method for predicting the iron concentration in silicon solar cells by current-voltage characteristics" 

Sincerely yours,
