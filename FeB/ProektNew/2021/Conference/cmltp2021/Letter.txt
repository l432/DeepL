Dear Organizing Committee of CM & LTP-2021,

1. Did I understand correctly that our abstract 
"Estimation of Iron Concenration in Silicon Solar Cell by 
Kinetics of Light-Induced Change in Short-Circuit Current"
(O. Olikh, V. Kostylyov, V. Vlasiuk, R. Korkishko)
has been accepted for presentation at the CM & LTP-2021?


2. I apologize, but I would like to make an entreaty. 
My head let me down and 
I  unfortunately forgot to mention the source of research funding - 
National Research Foundation of Ukraine, project 2020.02/0036
”Development of physical base of both acoustically controlled
modification and machine learning–oriented characterization
for silicon solar cells”
It will get me in big trouble. 
Can I make slight changes in the aforementioned abstract?
The corrected version of abstract is attached.

3. We  prefer the online format of our participation.

4. Finally, I  need documents to pay the registration fee.
Please, send me them.


Best regards
Oleg Olikh,
Associate Professor of 
Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv
