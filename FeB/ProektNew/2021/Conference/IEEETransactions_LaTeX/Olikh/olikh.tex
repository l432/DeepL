% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction}


\IEEEPARstart{N}{on--destructive} methods of evaluation of the impurities contamination in semiconductor crystals and structures, in particular solar cells (SCs), are important from an applied point of view.
To date, a not little collection of direct methods (an infrared tomography, an electron-paramagnetic resonance, a non-stationary spectroscopy, etc.) as well as indirect methods (a surface photovoltage, a minority carrier lifetime measurements) has been developed to solve this problem.
But almost all of them require special sample preparing or/and specialized equipment.
At the same time, the current--voltage curve (IVC) measurement is a widespread method of SC characterization and allows to determine a number of fundamental SC parameters.
Evidently SC parameters in particular and the processes of carrier propagation in general depend on electrically active defects presence; therefore there is a possibility in principle to determine the impurity concentration by IVC shape.
And recent papers demonstrate a novel approach to extract
defect properties from inexpensive IV measurements of completed
devices \cite{HowMuchPhysics}.

One of the main obstacles of such a convenient and express method developing is the multiparameter relationship between the contamination of recombination centers and IVC characteristics, which are determined by experimental curves fitting.
However, in the last decade, the deep learning, which are enable to solve problems without clear algorithmization, have been successfully used in various fields of theoretical and applied physics \cite{MachLean_RevModPhys,MachLeanJAP,MachLeanPPV}.
This gives hope for an real implementation of aforesaid SC characterization method with using of deep learning approach (so to say "deep learning for deep levels").

In this work, we use numerical device models to show the possibility of such an approach fulfillment using the example of evaluation the iron concentration in $n^+$--$p$--$p^+$-Si by the ideality factor value.
The reasons for aforesaid system consideration are following.
Although the ideality factor $n=2$ is often used to describe the trap related recombination, $n$ value is known to depend on defect parameters, including the concentration \cite{n2_Beier,n2McIntosh,n2Kaminski,HAMEIRI2013251,Heide}.
Consequently the ideality factor is often used to characterize the various
semiconductor barrier structures \cite{Heide,Duan,n_CharGaN,n_CharSemic,n_CharPhysRevAppl}.
We have previously demonstrated \cite{Olikh2019SM} the correlation between defect contamination and $n$ value, but the corresponding analytic expressions were not obvious and calibration curves were needed.
The iron is a major contaminant as well as one of the most detrimental(and hence, best
characterized)
metal impurities in silicon photovoltaic devices \cite{HowMuchPhysics,FeB:Schmidt}.
A simple back surface field (BSF) $n^+$--$p$--$p^+$ structure is important from an applied point of view.

is one of themost detrimental point defects in silicon PV devices.

The deep learning is based on learn by examples.
In this work the labeled dataset has been simulated by using SCAPS-1D \cite{SCAPS1,SCAPS2}, which was widely used to model silicon-based devices \cite{SCAPSuseSi4,SCAPSuseSi1,SCAPSuseSi6} as well.


The work milestone are following
(i)~the IVC simulation of numerous $n^+$--$p$--$p^+$-Si structure with various parameters for different temperatures;
(ii)~the fitting of the IVC set according to the two--diode model and the extraction of $n$ value set;
(iii)~the training of deep neural network (DNN) to estimate an iron-related defect contamination by using some dataset part and DNN testing with another part.
The consequent Sections give the details.


\cite{MI_JAP}

\section{Simulation Details}

\subsection{Temperature Dependencies of Material Parameters}

To receive more relevant labeled data, the IVC simulation was performed with regard to following silicon properties:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item~the bandgap temperature dependence according to P\"assler equation \cite{Pasler};
  \item~the doping induced bandgap narrowing \cite{EgNarrow};
  \item~the thermal carrier velocities from \cite{Nc:Green};
  \item~the temperature dependence of effective states density  according to \cite{Si_ni_Couderc};
  \item~the free carrier effective masses from \cite{OMara}
  \item~the carrier mobilities according to Klaassen's theory  \cite{KLAASSEN953};
  \item~the temperature and doping level dependencies of band--to--band and Auger recombination coefficients from \cite{Si_BtB} and \cite{Si_Auger} respectively.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Defect Parameters}

The calculations were carried out under the assumption that the defect--assisted recombination was
bound up with iron--related deep levels.
Iron atoms were speculated to be uniformly located in both SC base ($p$--region) and BSF--layer ($p^+$--region) with concentration $N_{\mathrm{Fe}}$.
And simulations were carried out for two cases.
In the first equilibrium one, the iron is believed to be both in the interstitial lattice position ($\mathrm{Fe}_i$) and in the trigonal pair with shallow acceptors (boron, $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$).
The pair's fraction does not constant in SC regions and is given by \cite{MurphyJAP2011,FeB:kinetic}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqNFeB}
    \frac{N_{\mathrm{FeB}}}{N_{\mathrm{Fe}}}=\frac{N_\mathrm{B}10^{-23}\exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{kT}\right)}
     {\left[1+\frac{N_\mathrm{B}}{10^{23}}\exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{kT}\right)\right]\left[1+\exp\left(-\frac{F-E_{\mathrm{Fe}_i}}{kT}\right)\right]}\,.
\end{equation}
where
$N_\mathrm{B}$ is the boron concentration,
$F$ is the Fermi level,
$E_b=0.582$~eV is the binding energy of the $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$ pairs,
$E_{\mathrm{Fe}_i}$ is the donor level, associated with $\mathrm{Fe}_i$.

In the second one, the $\mathrm{Fe}_i$ was suggested to be only presence  with uniform distribution.
Such state can be realized by heat treatment (210$^\circ$C, 3~min) \cite{FeB_Zong} or intense illumination \cite{FeBLight2}.

The donor level $E_{\mathrm{Fe}_i} = E_V+0.394$~eV
with electron $\sigma_{n,{\mathrm{Fe}}}=3.47\times10^{-11}T^{-1.48}$~cm$^2$ and
hole $\sigma_{p,{\mathrm{Fe}}}=4.54\times10^{-16}\exp\left(-\frac{0.05}{kT}\right)$~cm$^2$ capture cross-sections \cite{MurphyJAP2011,ROUGIEUX2018}
was associated with $\mathrm{Fe}_i$.
The donor level $E_{\mathrm{FeB}}^\mathrm{D}= E_V+0.10$~eV,
$\sigma_{n,{\mathrm{FeB}}}^\mathrm{D}=4\times10^{-13}$~cm$^2$,
$\sigma_{p,{\mathrm{FeB}}}^\mathrm{D}=2\times10^{-14}$~cm$^2$
and acceptor level $E_{\mathrm{FeB}}^\mathrm{A}= E_C-0.26$~eV,
$\sigma_{n,{\mathrm{FeB}}}^\mathrm{A}=5.1\times10^{-9}T^{-2.5}$~cm$^2$,
$\sigma_{p,{\mathrm{FeB}}}^\mathrm{A}=3.32\times10^{-10}\exp\left(-\frac{0.262}{kT}\right)$~cm$^2$
\cite{Istratov1999,MurphyJAP2011,ROUGIEUX2018}
were used in simulation for $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$.

\subsection{Structure Parameters}

The dark IVCs for $n^+$--$p$--$p^+$-Si structure were simulated.
The thickness and donor concentration for emitter layer ($n^+$) were $0.5$~$\mu$m and $10^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$.
The BSF--layer with thickness  $1$~$\mu$m and acceptor concentration $5\times10^{18}$~cm$^{-3}$ was used.
The base thickness $d_p$ ($150$--$240$~$\mu$m) and doping level (boron concentration, $N_\mathrm{B}=10^{15}$--$10^{17}$~cm$^{-3}$) changed from one simulation to another.
Other varied parameters were temperature ($T=290$--$340$~K) and iron concentration ($N_{\mathrm{Fe}}=10^{10}$--$10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$).

To obtain training labeled dataset, 15048 IVCs were simulated with parameters, which evenly
(for $T$ and $d_p$ in linear scale, for $N_{\mathrm{Fe}}$ and $N_\mathrm{B}$ in logarithmic scale)
distributed over the mentioned ranges.
Besides some test labeled dataset were prepared.
For example, $d_p$, $N_{\mathrm{Fe}}$ and $N_\mathrm{B}$ values are equal to values of training dataset and $T$ differs from them
for one of test dataset, which labeled "T-varied".
The values of $d_p$, $N_{\mathrm{Fe}}$ and $N_\mathrm{B}$ are different from training dataset mesh in "d-varied",
"Fe-varied" and "B-varied" dataset, respectively.
"All-varied" dataset was calculated with using all parameter values, unmatched to ones of training dataset.
The precise parameters values are listed in  Supplementary Material.

Subsubsection text here.


% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex,
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centering
%\subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.




\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.





% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
