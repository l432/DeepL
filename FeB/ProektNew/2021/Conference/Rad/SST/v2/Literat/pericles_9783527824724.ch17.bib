abstract = {Summary In this review paper, we list the basic properties of the most relevant point defect quantum bits or quantum bit candidates that have been harnessed to realize single photon sources and quantum devices, or they can be potentially employed to this end. This review demonstrates that joint efforts of ab initio simulations and experiments were very fruitful to achieve ground breaking results in thisfield.}
