abstract = {Summary This chapter focuses on “point defects,” that is, defects with a rather local structure involving a single or a pair of atoms. Such point defects may introduce an alteration of its surroundings within the crystal by a change of charge distribution at similar geometry or even forcing a local change of the lattice structure. One of the most dominant intrinsic defects in silicon carbide (SiC) is the carbon vacancy. The chapter describes the most sensitive electrical characterization technique, and deep level transient spectroscopy. To accompany the experimental techniques, an ab-initio technique, namely, density functional theory is widely used for assessment of potential point defects. The chapter reviews recent findings of the two types of vacancies in SiC, the carbon vacancy and the silicon vacancy, and a collective summary of all unambiguously assigned extrinsic electrically active defects, primarily the ones caused by transition metals.}
