Dear Organizing Committee AAAFM-UCLA,

I apologize, but I would like to make an entreaty. 
My head let me down and 
I  unfortunately forgot to mention the source of research funding - 
National Research Foundation of Ukraine, project 2020.02/0036
”Development of physical base of both acoustically controlled
modification and machine learning–oriented characterization
for silicon solar cells”
It will get me in big trouble. 

Can I make slight changes in abstract 
(ID 817 "Ultrasound as Functional Influence Tool on FeB pair Association in Silicon Solar Cells")?
The corrected version of abstract is attached.
I made changes  in account, aploaded new version, but I can not to change "Contribution_817.pdf"


Best regards
Oleg Olikh,
Associate Professor of 
Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv
