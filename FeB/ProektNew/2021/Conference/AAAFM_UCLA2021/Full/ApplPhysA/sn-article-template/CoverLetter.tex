Dear Editors,

%Enclosed is a manuscript entitled “XXX XXXX XXXXX” by sb, which we are submitting for publication in the journal of …. We have chosen this journal because it deals with …
Enclosed with this letter you will find an electronic submission of the ma\-nu\-script entitled ``Intensification of iron-boron complex association in silicon solar cells under acoustic wave action'' by Oleg Olikh, Vitaliy Kostylyov,
Victor Vlasiuk, Roman Korkishko, and Roman Chupryna.
%This paper is original and has not
%neither previously nor
%simultaneously in whole or in part been submitted anywhere else.
All authors have read and approved the final version submitted.
No part of this paper has been published elsewhere.
No conflict of interest exists in the submission of this manuscript.

Defect engineering in semiconductors structure is one of the most meaningful application tasks.
Irradiation and thermal treatment are ordinary ways to solve this problem.
But the ultrasound showed abilities to affect defects as well.
The present manuscript focuses on the experimental investigation of the influence of acoustic waves on admixture iron, which is a critical impurity in silicon--based technology.
The acoustically driven acceleration of the iron--boron complex association has been revealed.
We believe that using ultrasound for defect engineering would be of interest to the journal’s readers.


%Mechano--sorptive is sometimes denoted as accelerated creep.
%It has been experimentally observed that the creep of parer accelerates if it is subjected to a cyclic moisture content.
%This is of large practical importance for the paper industry.
%The present manuscript describes a micromechanical model on the fibre network level that is able to capture the experimentally observed behaviour.
%In particular, the difference between mechano--sorptive creep in tension is analysed.


%The paper demonstrates [significant finding and its significance]. As such this paper should be of interest to a broad readership including those interested in [what kinds of research, topics, techniques – should be those targeted by the journal]
%We believe that sth would be of interest to the journal’s readers.

%Three potential independent reviewers who have excellent  knowledge about  this paper are

We would  very much appreciate it if you would consider the manuscript for publication in the \emph{Applied Physics A}.
%We appreciate your consideration of our manuscript, and we look forward to receiving comments from the reviewers.

%Dear Editors
%It is more than 12 weeks since I submitted our manuscript (No: ) for possible publication in your journal. I have not yet received a reply and am wondering whether you have reached a decision. I should appreciated your letting me know what you have decided as soon as possible.
