Dear Dr. Aditi Awate,

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to transfer the manuscript.
If possible, I would prefer to choose the Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics.
Unfortunately, I'm not ready for the conditions of Open Access.  
What should I do to transfer the manuscript "as is"?

With kind regards,
Oleg Olikh

Dear Dr. Oleg Olikh,

Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics is an Open Choice journal. Springer journals with the Open Choice model offer authors a choice to:

Publish your manuscript as a regular publication: there are no article processing charges (APCs), but the article can only be accessed and read by subscribers to the journal.
or
Publish your manuscript as an open access (OA) publication: this requires payment of the article processing charges, but your article will be free to read and accessible for everyone. 
 
More information about publishing Open Choice can be found here. In addition, Springer Nature offers a free open access support service to make it easier for our authors to discover and apply for funding to cover article processing charges (APCs): https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/funding
 
If you prefer to publish your paper without paying an APC, you can still select this journal and opt for the regular publication option. 

Please could you confirm if you are happy for me to transfer your manuscript to Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics?
 
Best regards,
Aditi Awate, M.Sc.
