Dear Dr. Aditi Awate,

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to transfer the manuscript.
If possible, I would prefer to choose the Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics.
Unfortunately, I'm not ready for the conditions of Open Access.  
What should I do to transfer the manuscript "as is"?

With kind regards,
Oleg Olikh
