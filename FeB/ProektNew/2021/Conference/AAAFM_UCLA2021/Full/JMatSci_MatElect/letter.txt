Dear Journal Editorial Office
Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics,

I edited the manuscript (Intensification of iron-boron complex association in silicon solar cells under acoustic wave action) and approved Submission.
I very much hope for a positive decision from the Editorial Office. 

With kind regards,
Oleg Olikh
