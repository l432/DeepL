\emph{Page 1, column 2, paragraph 3: The origin of the iron in the diodes should be explained. How are the diodes contaminated with iron? }

\noindent
\textcolor[rgb]{0.51,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{Reply:}}
The technological process of solar cells (SCs) manufacturing from Cz-p-Si wafers included the formation of separating and isotype barriers ($n^+$-$p$ and $p$-$p^+$ junctions) by diffusion of phosphorus (POCl$_3$) and boron (BCl$_3$) from the gas phase, respectively; thermal oxidation; thermal annealing; photolithography; etching the dividing groove; chemical treatments; magnetron sputtering of aluminum contacts to the front and back sides.

It has been found that some SC lots have significantly worse parameters compared to typical solar cells for this technological process.
In particular, the photoconversion efficiency was almost halved.
The analysis showed that the reason for such a deterioration in the SC parameters is a sharp drop in the diffusion length of minority charge carriers (electrons) $L_n$ in the SC base.
Additional experiments with thermal annealing at temperatures of 200$^\circ$C and 90$^\circ$C
(the procedure is described by Tayyib~\emph{et al.}\cite{TAYYIB201221})
showed that the decrease in $L_n$ value is caused by iron impurities available in the SC base at concentrations up to $4\cdot10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$.
It has also been found that the source of iron impurity is insufficiently pure chemicals that were used for chemical treatments in the technological process, obtained from another supplier.
These reagents were the source of contamination in the process of manufacturing experimental SC samples.

To study the effect of ultrasonic loading on the kinetics of the transformation  of iron-boron pairs, samples with varying degrees of iron contamination (iron concentration $2\cdot10^{12}$-$4\cdot10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$) were taken.

More detailed information about iron sources was added (page~1, column~2, paragraphs~3 and 4).

\emph{Page 1, column 2, paragraph 5: How was the excess carrier density, which is induced by the LED illumination, estimated? This point should be explained. }

\noindent
\textcolor[rgb]{0.51,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{Reply:}}
The excess carrier density was estimated by using open-circuit voltage value $V_\mathrm{OC}$.
According to Sachenko \emph{et. al.}\cite{JAPSach}
\begin{equation}
  \Delta n=-\frac{n_0}{2}+\sqrt{\frac{n_0^2}{4}+n_i\exp\left(\frac{qV_\mathrm{OC}}{kT}\right)}
\end{equation}
where
$n_0$ is the equilibrium electron concentration,
$n_i$ is the intrinsic electron concentration.

The short information was added to the revised manuscript (page~2, column~1, paragraph~3).

\emph{Page 3, column 1, paragraph 3: The obtained iron concentration is compared to results obtained from diffusion length measurements. There should be a reference to these measurements or more details should be given.}

\noindent
\textcolor[rgb]{0.51,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{Reply:}}
The diffusion length before ($L_{n0}$) and after ($L_{n1}$) pair dissociation was measured using spectral dependencies of short circuit current\cite{LnIscMethod}.
Then the iron concentration was determined by using Zoth and Bergholz\cite{FeB_Zong} equation:
\begin{equation}
  N_\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{cm}^{-3})=1.06\cdot10^{16}\left(\frac{1}{L_{n1}^2}-\frac{1}{L_{n0}^2}\right)(\mu\mathrm{m}^{-2})
\end{equation}

\noindent
\textcolor[rgb]{0.51,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{Reply:}}

\emph{Figure 5: This plot is confusing and must be revised. What is the main statement of this figure? What are the differences between the samples and why do the results change from sample to sample? The axes should have the same scaling. What are the light blue bars in (a)? }

\noindent
\textcolor[rgb]{0.51,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{Reply:}}
Figure~5 was changed by Table~I.
The main assignment of this data is an illustration of

\noindent
i)~USL actually does not influence the $\tau_\mathrm{dis}$  magnitude;

\noindent
ii)~some pairs do not dissociate under illumination in the USL case when light--induced pair dissociation is close to saturation.
The decrease in illumination intensity reduces the last effect at the given illumination times.

The main differences between the samples are the iron concentrations.
However, data show that
the effect of ultrasound does not qualitatively change with the iron concentration alteration
(from sample to sample).
The value of acousto-induced change in $N_\mathrm{Fe,fit}$ value depends on ultrasound intensity
(see data for sample SC350-1, $W_\mathrm{ill}=0.16$~W/cm$^2$) and frequency.


The dissociation rate of FeB pairs depends on iron concentration, light intensity, and
temperature\cite{Schmidt2019,FeBLight2,FeBKin2019,Lagowskii1993}.
There is a reason of $\tau_\mathrm{dis}$ value change from panel to panel in Fig.~5 in the unrevised manuscript (from row to row in Table~I in the revised manuscript)

The light blue bars in Fig.~5(a) (the unrevised manuscript) corresponded to another ultrasound intensity
(0.6~W/cm$^2$).

\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.50,1.00}{\textbf{Comment~10.}}
\emph{Main Problem}
\emph{The impact of ultrasound on the iron-boron-pair reaction was first reported by Ostapenko and Bell in 1995 [1]. They found that the iron boron pairs dissociate due to an ultrasound treatment. This is in contradiction to the findings, which are reported herein. In the contribution under review it is found that the association of the FeB pairs is enhanced by the ultrasound treatment. This contradiction must absolutely be discussed by the authors otherwise the manuscript cannot be published.}

 }

\noindent
\textcolor[rgb]{0.51,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{Reply:}}
We do not keep silent about reports Ostapenko \emph{et al.} --- see Refs.26,27;
page~3, column~2, paragraph~1; page~7, column~2, paragraph~1 in the unrevised manuscript.
But Reviewer is right and more attention should be paid to the comparison of the findings.

In our opinion,
the reported herein and previous results have a lot in common.
According to Ostapenko \emph{et al.}\cite{Ostapenko1995SST}
Fe$_i$ has to ``jump'' to the next nearest interstitial under ultrasound action;
we state about the decrease in Fe$_i$ migration energy value
as well as enhance of Fe$_i$ diffusivity
in case of ultrasound loading.
The effectiveness of ultrasound influence increase with the rise of temperature in both cases:
according to Ostapenko \emph{et al.},\cite{Ostapenko1994APL,Ostapenko1995SST}
the diffusion length increases from 10.5~$\mu$m to 13~$\mu$m at 20$^\circ$C and up to
22~$\mu$m at 70$^\circ$C;
$\Delta E_\mathrm{US}$ increases from 3~meV to 8~meV with temperature change
from 300~K to 340~K at  $f_\mathrm{US}=0.3$~MHz and $W_\mathrm{US}=0.76$~W/cm$^2$
(Fig.6 in the revised manuscript).
The difference in the action of ultrasound
(the iron-boron pairs dissociation or the enhancing of pairing)
is associated with the difference in the intensity of the acoustic influence.
For instance, the researchers used acoustic strain $\xi_\mathrm{US}=10^{-5}$-$10^{-4}$
was used\cite{Ostapenko1995}
to dissociate FeB pairs in Cz--Si.
Furthermore,
Ostapenko and Bell\cite{Ostapenko1995} regarded the resonance condition of
pair reorientation (first step of dissociation) and used $25-70$~kHz.
In our case,  $\xi_\mathrm{US}<2\cdot10^{-6}$ and $f_\mathrm{US}=2-30$~MHz are deficient to effectively overcome the Coulombic attraction between Fe$_i^+$ and B$_s^-$.
Additionally, the presented data show that the effectiveness of acoustically--induced change
decreases as the ultrasound frequency increases.

It should be noted that Ostapenko \emph{et al.}\cite{Ostapenko1994APL} asserted
``in the  case  of predominant  dissociated  pairs,  it [ultrasound treatment] may promote  the
pairing reaction'' (page~1557, column~1, paragraph~2).
In our case, the predominant  dissociation was realized by intense illumination, and then
the ultrasound loading accelerated pairing.
Thus, the reported results provided empirical evidence  for the above-mentioned prediction.


On the other hand, a certain manifestation of partial acoustically-induced FeB dissociation could be
a decrease in the concentration of pairs, which dissociate under illumination in the USL case.
In fact, if some pairs were dissociated by  ultrasound waves, which had been pre-exited
in the sample with a high initial  fraction of paired Fe,
they can not be dissociated under illumination.
The decrease in the temperature   or photon quantity leads to reduce in the set of FeB, which was modified by ultrasound, or in the set of FeB,
which was modified by the capture of light-induced electrons, respectively.
Sets cease to overlap and $N_\mathrm{Fe,fit}(W_\mathrm{US}>0)\simeq N_\mathrm{Fe,fit}(W_\mathrm{US}=0)$ --- see Table~I in the revised manuscript.


Finally, let's summarize the differences between the manuscript and previously reported results.
Ostapenko \emph{et al.}\cite{Ostapenko1995,Ostapenko1994APL,Ostapenko1995SST}
investigated the change in silicon properties (diffusion length) \textbf{after}
the action of ultrasound with high (above threshold) intensity.
This is the so-called ultrasound treatment mode of operation
and results  can be used to develop a new approach to semiconductor properties modification.
Our manuscript is devoted to the modification of the process
(short circuit current kinetics or FeB transformation),
\textbf{during} subthreshold acoustic wave propagation.
This is ultrasound loading mode,
which can be used for acoustically controlled tuning of the technological processes.

The additional information was added to the revised manuscript
(page~7, column~1, last paragraph; page~7, column~2, paragraph~1).
