Dear Dr. Yunus UZUN,

I apologize, but I would like to make an entreaty. 
My head let me down and 
I  unfortunately forgot to mention the source of research funding - 
National Research Foundation of Ukraine, project 2020.02/0036
”Development of physical base of both acoustically controlled
modification and machine learning–oriented characterization
for silicon solar cells”
It will get me in big trouble. 

Can I make slight changes in abstract 
(ID 41 "Deep-learning approach to the iron concentration evaluation in silicon solar cell")?
The corrected version of abstract is attached.

Best regards
Oleg Olikh,
Associate Professor of 
Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv
