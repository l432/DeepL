Test file filegrading MB, 30-8-2013
Example of a grading file for a property graded as a function of composition or position
Can be used for a doping density (ND or NA) or a defect density Nt
The first column can be the composition (when e.g. NA(y) is set in SCAPS) or the position in micrometer (when NA(x) is set in SCAPS)
The second column is a doping (or defect) density in 1/m3
In this example: NA(y) = (9^y) * 1.0E21 (thus linear in a log(NA) vs. y diagram)
Only 3 points are specified to illustrate the effect of the interpolation law (lin or log)
Interpolation: linear  (this is the key word for SCAPS)

x (micrometer) or composition y	NA (1/m3)
0.0	1.0E21
0.5	3.0E21
1.0	9.0E21
