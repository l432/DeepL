\abstractformat{Abstract.} 
Initially, this work briefly outlines how ultrasound can modify and characterize the defect system in semiconductors. 
Then, the study experimentally examines the effect of different types of acoustic waves on the association 
of FeB pairs in monocrystalline silicon. 
The results reveal that as the frequency of longitudinal waves increases, the ultrasound's effectiveness in accelerating the association rate decreases. 
Conversely, exciting transverse waves show the opposite trend. 
The study also assesses the potential to obtain a positron-annihilation response from the FeB complex in silicon, 
highlighting the advantages of conducting such measurements under ultrasound loading of the crystal.


\section{Introduction}\label{S1}
\vspace{-6pt}

Defects are well known to impact the properties of semiconductor devices significantly. 
In this regard, defect engineering, which involves controlled tuning of the defect-impurity subsystem to achieve new crystal, structure, or device properties, is crucial.
One of the powerful tools for such active defect engineering is applying acoustic vibrations in the ultrasonic frequency range. 
For example, ultrasound treatment can stimulate the diffusion of various defects at temperatures close to room temperature 
due to the acoustically induced (AI) decrease in activation energy or over-barrier motion 
\cite{Ostapenko1999, 
%Ostap:PhotoLum ?, 
BORKOVSKA2003}.
Additionally, ultrasound (US) can cause the reconstruction of intrinsic point defects \cite{Bahar2003, RITTER2008, Wosinski} 
or the annealing of radiation-induced defects 
\cite{UST:OstrovCsI, 
%UST:LED_SM, 
GORB2020, 
Gorb2010}.
Often, ultrasound serves not as the primary tool for modification 
but as an additional factor influencing the process during conventional technological operations, 
such as ion implantation \cite{Litovchenko2015, ROMANJUK2005MatSci} or film deposition \cite{Wang:JLum, US:ZnOfilm}.

In addition to the residual effects of ultrasound, acousto-dynamic effects also attract significant interest. 
In this case, changes in the state of defects and modifications to semiconductor properties 
are observed only under ultrasound loading (USL) conditions. 
After the cessation of acoustic wave (AW) propagation, 
the defect subsystem returns to its initial state, and the properties revert to their original condition.
In particular, acousto-induced effects have been discovered, including changes in the configuration of metastable defects
(FeB pairs and A-centers in Si \cite{YOlikhTPL2011, Ostrovskii2001}, 
EL2 in GaAs \cite{buyanova1994}, DX in AlGaAs \cite{belyaev1994}), 
recharging of point defects 
(Te, vacancy, V-O in silicon structures \cite{Korotchenkov1995, Olikh2018JAP, Olikh:Ultras}, 
heterostructures GaAs/AlGaAs \cite{Zaveryukhin2002}), 
reconstruction of the Cottrell cloud 
(SiGe/Si, CdTe:Cl, CdHgTe \cite{Kuryliuk2009,
%(або залишити Ostrovskii2001), 
YOlikh:SupMicr, Vlasenko2000}), 
and the formation of non-equilibrium dislocation clusters 
(GaP \cite{Gontaruk1998}).
Such effects enable the creation of functional electronic devices, 
where control of the information signal relies on the inhomogeneities in the medium, which arise from the US action.


Acoustic waves also serve as a tool for characterizing the defect subsystem of semiconductors.
For example, modifying elastic moduli during the formation of Jahn-Teller defects can cause extrema to appear in the temperature dependencies of US velocity and absorption.
Such anomalies enable the successful investigation of intrinsic defects \cite{USM:Mitsumoto2014, USM:SEYIDOV2016} 
and substitutional atoms \cite{USM:Zhevstovskikh, USM:YI2009} across various crystals.
Another approach to US modification of traditional defect research methods involves acousto-dynamic effects. 
Specifically, while ultrasound propagates, the system's response to external influences unrelated to elastic vibrations changes. 
It allows for obtaining more detailed information about defects than without AW.
In particular, defect identification has been carried out using modified DLTS spectra,  
transmission and reflection measurements \cite{Kor1996, Ostrovskii2001, OSTROVSKII2000, SST:USmethod}.

This work examines the potential advantages of the acousto-positron perturbation technique, 
which involves conducting positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) under ultrasonic loading. 
The previously mentioned possible AI changes in the state of defects indicate that ultrasound can modulate the conventional PAS signal, 
including both positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) and coincidence Doppler broadening (CDB) spectroscopy 
(encompassing both high-momentum component W and low-momentum component S).
Consequently, such studies could be more informative and, more importantly, may enhance the method's capabilities.
For example, PAS is known to be most suitable for studying vacancy-type and acceptor-like defects \cite{tuomisto2019}. 
The advantages of ultrasound as a defect engineering tool \cite{Olikh2018JAP} may enable the expansion 
of the class of defects that can be studied using positron annihilation. 
In other words, the combination of PAS and ultrasound can provide new opportunities for studying defects in semiconductors, 
and this work aims to discuss the possibilities and prospects of this approach.

This study is focused on iron-related defects in Si:B.
Iron is known to be one of the most detrimental metallic impurities in photovoltaic silicon.
In $p$-type Si, iron atoms are predominantly bound into $\mathrm{Fe}_i^+\mathrm{B}_s^−$ pairs 
or occupy interstitial sites as $\mathrm{Fe}_i^+$, 
forming defects that are traditionally difficult to study using PAS.
The subsequent section presents experimental results that illustrate the variability in the effect of ultrasound on the defect subsystem.
Specifically, it examines how vibrations with varying types influence the AI transformation processes 
between Fe$_i$ and FeB, which can occur readily at room temperature \cite{FeBAssJAP2014}. 
The penultimate section is devoted to quantitative estimates of positron annihilation in the FeB complex. 
Finally, the article concludes in the last section.

\section{Positron Annihilation on FeB Complex: the Searching Estimations}

The difference in both the size of atoms and their electron structure in FeB complex 
is the source of forming the strains and deformations in the crystal lattice of silicon. 
The thermalized positron has the excursion length \cite{Krause1999} equal, 
approximately, to 1000~{\AA} over the temperature range $\sim25$ to $300$~K 
and thus may form a many-body electron-positron localized state at the 
FeB complex in case its concentration is not very much lower than about $10^{15} – 10^{14}$~cm$^{−3}$. 
The rate of this localization ($k$) with the consequent emission of annihilation 
gamma-quanta out of the volume of FeB complex is determined by measuring the positron annihilation characteristics. 
The latter are known to be determined by both the open volume and chemical nature of atoms involved in a defect \cite{Krause1999}. 
The positron probing of defects becomes indispensable when other methods 
(e. g., such as EPR and IR spectroscopy), are not informative ones.  
In addition, also one may point out to the NMR and acoustic nuclear magnetic resonance 
that are not used for studying nuclei having zero nuclear spin.


\noindent \textbf{Positron Trapping.}
To detect acoustic loading on a defect by positron annihilation 
one needs to have positron states related to it. 
A propensity of the thermalized positron to be localized in the region of negative effective charge 
related to the impurity atoms of different nature together 
with the open volume of a defect is generally accepted to describe by the trapping model \cite{Brandt1974}: 
\begin{equation}\label{eqA1}
  k=\lambda_0\frac{\eta}{1-\eta}\cong\lambda_0\frac{\tau_\mathrm{av}-\tau_0}{\tau_\mathrm{max}-\tau_\mathrm{av}}\,,
\end{equation}
where the resulting probability of  2–gamma annihilation 
is measured assuming that the positron trapping rate $k$ allows one 
to determine conditional probability $\eta$ of the event 
of 2–gamma annihilation of $e^+e^-$ pair in the centers studied \cite{Brandt1974,Arutyunov2013}:
\begin{equation}\label{eqA2}
  \eta=\frac{k}{\lambda_0+k}\,.
\end{equation}
The averaged positron lifetime $\tau_\mathrm{av}$ is expected 
to depend on the acoustic loading, and $\tau_0$ is a positron lifetime out of a defect; 
this value is not measured. 
As $\tau_0$ magnitude it is generally accepted to use so-called $\tau_\mathrm{bulk}$ value which is, e.g., 
determined experimentally for a defect--``free'' material. 
The cross-section of positron localization with the subsequent 2--gamma annihilation $\sigma_+$ determines the $k$ value:
\begin{equation}\label{eqA3}
  \sigma_+=k/C\,,
\end{equation}
where $C$ is the coefficient of localization of positron pair at the center \cite{Krause1999};  
$C=[\mathrm{FeB}]\times v_+$
($v_+$ is the velocity of positron on its excursion length $\sim (4\tau D_+)^{0.5}$
where $\tau$ and $D_+$ are the positron lifetime and the positron diffusion coefficient, respectively \cite{Krause1999,Brandt1974}. 
Over the range of concentrations [FeB] from $2\times10^{13}$~cm$^{−3}$ to $\sim10^{14}$~cm$^{−3}$ 
the $k$ value $k\{[FeB]; \sigma_+ = 10^{−12} \mathrm{cm}^2\}$
increases from $\sim0.5$ to $\sim1$~ns$^{−1}$. 
In the case of increase of the positron trapping cross section up to $10{−11}$~cm$^2$ 
for the same range of concentrations of defects the value of the positron trapping rate increases from $\sim2$ to $\sim10$~ns$^{−1}$.  
This range of the $k$ magnitudes is well detected using both PALS and CDB.
 
The $k$ value may turn out to be more pronounced due to yet much larger values of cross-sections. 
It should be noted in this connection that large cross sections $\sim\!3.32\times10^{–11}$~cm$^2$  
and $\sim\!10^{–10}$~cm$^2$  related to excitonic Auger capture of holes and multiphonon emission capture, 
respectively, have been reported for the FeB complex \cite{Paudyal2009,Istratov1999}. 

Thus, one can expect observing the emission of annihilation radiation modulated by USL on FeB centers 
whose association was shown to be accelerated in the solar cells \cite{Olikh2022:JMatSci}. 
Special interest in this connection is a paradoxical divergence in the frequency dependency of reduced 
energy barrier for Fe ion migration  when using longitudinal and transverse waves. 
This intriguing dependency observed suggests forming the anisotropic deformation field ambient FeB complex 
which consists of the atoms of Si, Fe, B and others, such as oxygen and carbon in Cz-grown silicon.


\noindent \textbf{Elementally-Specific Annihilation Radiation.}
The ion cores of different chemical nature in the atomic environment of the positron 
makes the emission of the high-momentum annihilation gamma-quanta to be elementally specific one inasmuch 
as the wave functions of the ion core electrons retain to a great extent their atomic character in solids.  
The data obtained for these electron-positron states by the angular correlation of annihilation radiation (ACAR) 
of high resolution for the poly-crystalline metallic Fe (in its $\gamma$--phase), 
as well as for so-called $\beta$--B and dislocation-free $n$–type FZ–Si [111] single crystal are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig6}1. 
The electron-positron ion radii $r_m$ obtained by these data are close to the values of ionic radii $r_i$: 
for different coordination numbers $r_i(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}; \mathrm{Fe}^{3+})$ and $r_i(\mathrm{Si}^{4+})$ values 
range 0.63 to $0.92\times10^{−8}$~cm and $0.4$ to $0.54\times10^{−8}$~cm, respectively; 
the ionic radius of boron $r_i(\mathrm{B}^{3+})$ is equal to $\simeq0.27\times10^{−8}$~cm \cite{Suchet1965,Rahm2016}. 
The $r_m$(B) value is larger than the length of ionic radius $r_i(\mathrm{B}^{3+})$ as the maximum overlapping of the ion core
 electrons and positron wave functions \cite{Ferrell1956} is shifted outwards the ion core of B atom more effectively than it takes place for ion cores of Fe and Si atoms.

        The measurements were performed at room temperature and their results are given
        for boron (dots), silicon (squares), and iron (triangles).

        similar spectrum of high-momentum components of 2–gamma annihilation radiation. 
}\label{fig6}
\end{figure}

The resulting emission of 2–gamma annihilation radiation out of Fe, Si, and B subvalent and ion core electron states 
to be probed with positrons follows the squares under the lines in Fig.~\ref{fig6}. 
Similar trend should be observed for the many-body electron-positron state at FeB pair including its complexes with common impurities in Cz-Si. 
The relative contributions of these elementally-specific channels of annihilation radiation depend on the both configuration and symmetry of FeB complex, 
thus manifesting themselves in the mutually interrelated both the average positron lifetime, 
$\tau_\mathrm{av}$, and conditional probabilities, $\eta$; 
see Eq.~\ref{eqA1} and Eq.~\ref{eqA2}. 
The numeral values of these parameters will be changed under USL, 
thus allowing one to observe the acoustic-positron annihilation phenomena. 
Instead of a high-precision ACAR measurements, the CDB may be used for detecting the electron-positron annihilation in the ion cores 
of atoms involved in the microstructure of defects, with the subsequent analysis of S-W-parameters of CDB spectra \cite{Krause1999}.

\section{Conclusion}


The effects of longitudinal and transverse acoustic waves on the formation of FeB pairs in silicon have been experimentally investigated.

The results show that the efficiency of ultrasonic influence on the association process depends significantly on the type of wave.

This suggests that ultrasound can be used to control the behavior of structural defects in semiconductors.

The characteristics of positron annihilation on the FeB complex have been analyzed, and the feasibility of using positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) under ultrasonic loading has been demonstrated.

Overall, the study shows that ultrasound can be a useful tool for controlling defect properties in semiconductors.
