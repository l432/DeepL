Dear Organizing Committee,

We kindly request the inclusion of our presentation "Variability in FeB Pair Association Rates in Silicon under Ultrasound Loading: Effects of Acoustic Wave Types" (O. Olikh and N. Arutyunov) in the program of The International Workshop on Positron Studies of Defects 2024 (PSD-24). The relevant file is attached to this email.

Dear Prof. Rafael Ferragut,
PSD-24 Chairman

My name is Oleg Olikh, and I am a professor in the Faculty of Physics at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Ukraine. I am the presenting author for the oral presentation
"Variability in FeB Pair Association Rates in Silicon under Ultrasound Loading: Effects of Acoustic Wave Types" at the upcoming The International Workshop on Positron Studies of Defects 2024.

With over 25 years of experience in semiconductor defect research (Scopus Author ID: 6506623724), my primary areas of interest include defect engineering — particularly by ultrasound—and methods for defect characterization, incorporating machine learning techniques recently. The abstract, which is submitted for PSD-24, is reflective of my research interests and scientific pursuits.

Participating in conferences like PSD-24 is vital for me to stay abreast of our field's latest developments and share my findings with the international community. Traditionally, my research has been supported by state grants.

However, due to the devastating onset of the war, Ukraine is now unable to fund scientific research that does not pertain directly to military needs. Consequently, I find myself in the position of needing to request financial assistance. I am completely aware that requests of this nature have been frequent in recent years and may be burdensome.

Therefore, I kindly appeal to the Organizing Committee for a grant to cover the conference fee and travel expenses for my Ukraine - Italy - Ukraine journey.

Despite the difficulties, I continue my research activity in Ukraine. And I hope your support will enable my participation in the significant event that PSD-24 is, and allow me to fully engage with the global scientific community.


Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

Dear Oleg Olikh,

We express our solidarity with the situation in Ukraine and deeply sympathize with the challenges you are facing. However, we regret to inform you that we are unable to provide substantial assistance at this time. Due to ongoing crises and conflicts, several attendees have decided not to participate in the conference. The event is entirely supported by the registration fees, and currently, we are operating at a loss. I will personally have to cover these losses with my own funds.

 

Therefore, we are unable to assist with your travel and accommodation expenses. We can only offer you the option to pay the registration fee for PSD-24 in Como with the amount you can manage, also considering our current situation.

 

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

Rafael Ferragut

Dear Prof. Rafael Ferragut,
PSD-24 Chairman


Дуже дякую за вашу пропозицію to pay my registration fee for PSD-24.
Це буде дуже важливо для мене. Можливо, для того щоб здійснити цю процедуру мені потрібно надати якусь додаткову інформацію?

Також я був би надзвичайно вдячним, якби Організаційний Комітет надіслав мені офіційного листа, де було б вказано що доповідь прийнята до програми конференції, а також про підтримку щодо сплати registration fee. Такий документ суттєво допоможе у пошуці гранту для покриття travel and accommodation expenses.

Ще раз висловлюю свою подяку за підтримку.



Dear Prof. Rafael Ferragut,
PSD-24 Chairman

Thank you very much for your offer to pay my registration fee for PSD-24. This will be very important for me. Could you please let me know if I need to provide any additional information to complete this procedure?

Additionally, I would be extremely grateful if the Organizing Committee could send me an official letter confirming that my presentation has been accepted into the conference program, along with the support for the registration fee payment. Such a document would greatly assist me in seeking a grant to cover my travel and accommodation expenses.

Once again, I express my gratitude for your support.
Best regards,
