In general, interstitial iron is already mobile at room temperature and can interact with various impurities.
Over 30 iron-related complexes have been identified in silicon,
and nearly 25 energy levels associated with iron-related defects have been reported in the silicon bandgap across different studies \cite{Istratov1999,Gwozdz2022,JYOTHI2015}.
For example, iron forms complexes with carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, and other metal impurities, as well as with native defects in silicon.
However, in terms of their impact on photovoltaic performance, two primary factors must be considered.
First, the concentration of the relevant defects is crucial.
It is widely recognized that in $p$--type silicon under equilibrium conditions, most iron impurity atoms pair with acceptors
(e.g., boron in Si:B) \cite{Kimerling1983,Istratov1999}.
The concentration of other complexes is significantly lower,
and detailed investigation of these complexes requires specialized sample preparation,
such as additional doping with other expected complex components
or irradiation to increase the concentration of native defects \cite{Tang2013}.
Further supporting this, several methods used to evaluate the total iron concentration in $p$--Si rely on breaking the FeB pair \cite{Zoth1990,FeMethod2012,Olikh2021JAP}.
Second, the recombination activity of these centers must be considered,
as it depends on the defect energy level relative to the Fermi level and the charge carrier capture cross-section.
Interstitial iron and FeB pairs are among the most detrimental recombination-active impurities in $p$--Si \cite{Istratov1999,TeimurazJAP} in contrast to other iron-related defects.
Notably, iron gettering by oxygen precipitates or structural defects increases carrier lifetime \cite{Schoen2011,FeB:Vahanissi}.
In $n$--Si, Fe$_i$ is not a recombination-active impurity due to the filling of its energy level.
Reducing the impact of iron through gettering during phosphorus diffusion \cite{Schoen2011,FeB:Vahanissi,Vaehaenissi2017} or the formation of a
passivating layer \cite{Teimuraz2014JAP} is well-established and used in the solar cell industry.

Thus, our assumption that the primary influence of iron impurities in the $p$--regions of a solar cell on photoelectric parameters is due to
Fe$_i$B$_\mathrm{Si}$ pairs and Fe$_i$ is fully justified.
Furthermore, we emphasize that this paper focuses on the relative changes in parameters during
Fe$_i$B$_\mathrm{Si}$ $\rightleftarrows$ Fe$_i$ + B$_\mathrm{Si}$ transformation, which enables the isolation of these specific defects' contributions.

This answer is incorporated in the revised text on page 5, two last paragraph in Section 2.1. Simulation Details.




%In general, interstitial iron is already mobile at room temperature and it can interact with different impurities.
%More than 30 Fe-related complexes were detected in Si and almost 25 energy levels of Fe-related defects were reported in
%the bandgap of Si in different studies.
%Наприклад, залізо утворює комплекси з атомами вуглецю, кисню, водню, сірки, власними дефектами кремнію, іншими металевими домішками.
%Проте з точки зору впливу подібних комплексів на photovoltaic performance необхідно врахувати два основних фактора.
%По-перше, концентрацію відповідних дефектів.
%Загально прийнятою є думка, що в p-Si у рівноважному стані переважна кількість домішкових атомів заліза утворює пари з акцептором (наприклад з бором у Si:B).
%Концентрація інших комплексів набагато менша і для їх детального дослідження необхідно проводити спеціальну підготовку зразків на кшталт додаткового легування іншими компонентами очікуваного комплексу чи радіаційне опромінення для збільшення концентрації власних дефектів.
%Додатковим підтвердженням цього є те, що низка методів, спрямованих на оцінку загальної концентрації заліза у  p-Si спирається на процеси розбиття саме пар FeВ.
%По-друге, треба взяти до уваги рекомбінаційну активність центрів, яка залежить від розташування енергетичного рівня дефекту стосовно рівня Фермі та поперечного перерізу захоплення носіїв заряду.
%Interstitial iron and FeB pair are the one of the most detrimental recombination active impurities in р-silicon на відміну від інших iron-related defects.
%Так, iron gettering by oxygen precipitate or structural defects leads to збільшення часу життя носіїв заряду.
%В n-Si Fei не є рекомбінаційно активною домішкою внаслідок заповнення енергетичного рівня.
%Зменшення the impact of iron внаслідок gettering під час phosphorus diffusion чи створення просвітлюючого шару є добре відомими і використовуються у in solar cell industry.
%
%Таким чином, використане в роботі припущення про те, що основний вплив домішкового заліза в р-областях сонячного елементу на фотоелектричні параметри пов'язаний з FeB pair  and Fei є цілком виправданим.
%Крім того, підкреслимо, що в роботі акцентовано увагу саме на відносні зміни параметрів при перебудові Fe-FeB, що дозволяє додатково виокремити внесок саме цих дефектів.

\textcolor[rgb]{0.51,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{Reply:}}

Interstitial iron atoms exhibit high mobility in silicon \cite{Istratov1999}.
For example, the characteristic time required for FeB pair formation,
which depends on the diffusion coefficient of Fe$_i$, is given by the following expression \cite{FeBAssJAP2014,FeBKin2019,FeBAssSST2011}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqTass}
\tau=5.7\times10^5\,\frac{\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{K}\;\mathrm{cm}^3}\times\frac{T}{N_\mathrm{B}}\exp\left(\frac{0.65}{kT}\right)\,.
\end{equation}
where
$N_\mathrm{B}$ is the doping level.

That is, at room temperature, the formation of an equilibrium concentration of FeB pairs is completed within 24 hours,
while at $T=340$~K, the $\tau$ is approximately 10 minutes.
Therefore, iron contamination is not a determining factor in the long--term stability of silicon solar cells, unlike sodium atoms, which are considered one
of the primary contributors to potential-induced degradation \cite{Yamaguchi2021}.


The information on the characteristic time of FeB pair formation has been added to the revised manuscript (page 5, last paragraph in Section 2.2.).

\begin{mdframed}
The measurements were carried over the temperature range of 300-340~K.
The sample temperature was driven by a thermoelectric cooler controlled by an STS-21 sensor
and maintained constant by a PID algorithm embedded in the software that serves the experimental setup.
\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.07,0.00}{Notably, the characteristic time for FeB pair recovery after the cessation of illumination is approximately 13,000 seconds at 300 K
and only 600 seconds at 340 K \cite{FeBAssJAP2014,FeBKin2019}.
These limitations affect the measurement duration at high temperatures, and the experiments accounted for them.}

Initially, we note that the selected temperature range reflects the
realistic operating conditions of most silicon solar cells.
In our calculations, we accounted for the temperature dependencies of both silicon properties ---
including bandgap, the effective density of states; effective masses, thermal velocities and mobilities of charge carriers;
Auger and band-to-band recombination coefficients, and light absorption values ---
and defect parameters, such as energy level positions within the bandgap and electron and hole capture cross-sections.
Additionally, we considered the temperature dependence of the equilibrium concentration ratio of Fe$_i$ and FeB.
Specifically, the primary effect of increasing temperature on iron-related defects is the rise in the relative equilibrium
concentration of interstitial iron atoms
and the change in the charge carrier capture cross-section of each defect.

Accounting for all the above factors in the modeling process suggests that
the results presented in this work accurately reflect the impact of both defects
and defect parameter variation on solar cell performance under varying environmental conditions,
including temperature,  illumination type, and intensity.

Details on how temperature dependencies were accounted for in the simulation can be found on page 3, last two paragraphs


\begin{mdframed}
As can be seen from Table~1, calculations spanned a broad range of temperatures and base doping levels.
Therefore, to improve the accuracy of the calculations when inputting the initial parameters into SCAPS,
\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.07,0.00}{temperature and concentration (where applicable) dependencies of the following silicon parameters were taken into account}:

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt, parsep=0pt, topsep=0pt]
    \item bandgap according to Passler \cite{Passler2002};
    \item doping induced bandgap narrowing according to Yan \& Cuevas \cite{EgNarrow};
    \item effective density of states at conduction and valence band and intrinsic carrier concentration according to Couderc et al. \cite{Si_ni_Couderc};
    \item thermal carrier velocities according to Green \cite{Nc:Green};
    \item free carrier effective masses according to O’Mara et al. \cite{OMara};
    \item carrier mobilities according to Klaassen's theory \cite{KLAASSEN953};
\end{itemize}

The values of surface recombination coefficients were considered equal to the thermal velocities of carriers \cite{Fell2015}.
The calculations addressed recombination processes within the structural volume,
incorporating both intrinsic recombination and Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination at iron-related defects.
In the first case, processes of band-to-band radiation recombination were considered
(where the calculation of the corresponding coefficient included the fraction of radiatively emitted photons
reabsorbed via band-to-band processes according to Niewelt et al.\cite{Brad2022})
and Auger recombination (where the coefficients considered the effect of Coulomb enhancement \cite{AugerSi2022} and
\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.07,0.00}{temperature dependence} \cite{Si_Auger}).

Case~2.
Iron atoms predominantly form pairs with acceptors, $\left[\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s\right] \gg \left[\mathrm{Fe}_i\right]$,
\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.07,0.00}{but the exact concentration ratio depends on the position of the Fermi level and temperature} \cite{FeB:kinetic,MurphyJAP2011}
and varies from point to point within the solar cell.
Further details about calculation of the concentration profiles of Fe$_i$B$_s$ and Fe$_i$ are provided in \cite{Olikh2022PPV,Olikh2019SM}.
This case corresponds to prolonged storage of the structure in darkness or under conditions of low-intensity ($< 0.01$~J~cm$^{-2}$ \cite{Macdonald2004}) illumination.

During the calculations, it was assumed that Fe$_i$ forms a single donor level,
while the Fe$_i$B$_s$ pair has a trigonal configuration and acts as an amphoteric defect.

One of the objectives of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using variations
in short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, solar cell efficiency, or fill factor,
which results from the decay of iron-containing pairs, to estimate the concentration of iron impurities.
Our simulations revealed that the relative changes in these parameters depend
not only on the iron concentration but also on temperature and
other solar cell characteristics, such as doping level and base thickness.
In other words, when determining the magnitude of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ based on changes in short-circuit current,
a set of parameters (descriptors) must be used: ($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$).
Evidently, incorporating additional information, such as changes in efficiency ($\varepsilon \eta$), along with an expanded
set of descriptors ($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$, $\varepsilon \eta$),
increases the complexity of calculations due to the growing number of input parameters.
However, this should enhance the accuracy of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ predictions.
Meanwhile, variations in short-circuit current and efficiency are not entirely independent,
as both essentially characterize the same physical process --- the diffusion of photo-induced carriers.
Confirmation of this has resulted from analyzing the correlations between parameters --- see Fig.~12 in the manuscript.
Thus, the set ($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$, $\varepsilon \eta$)
contains useful and redundant information compared to ($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$).
To assess the degree of redundancy in different descriptor sets, we employed principal component analysis (PCA),
which constructs a new dataset of uncorrelated principal components (PCs).
PCA also enables the evaluation of each PC’s contribution to the total variance of the information.
Our analysis showed that, for example, when estimating $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ using a set of
seven descriptors ($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$, $\varepsilon \eta$, $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$, $\varepsilon F\!F$)
obtained under 940~nm illumination, five PCs account for more than 99.5\% of the variance in the input data.
Therefore, applying PCA to transform the seven input variables and using only five is fully justified,
as it significantly simplifies calculations with minimal impact on estimation accuracy.

In the manuscript, PCA was not used to evaluate impurity levels.
The conclusions and abstract only mentioned its potential usefulness in estimating the concentration of iron impurities
based on variations in several photovoltaic parameters.
We apologize for any possible ambiguities in the wording.
In the revised manuscript, we have aimed for the most precise formulations.
Finally, we would like to thank the Reviewer for an idea about PCA use to distinguish the contributions of different defects in future research.


The corrections were made in the manuscript on page 15, 1st paragraph in Section 3.5.

The previous subsections demonstrated that by using the relative changes in photovoltaic energy conversion parameters following the dissociation of FeB pairs
(e.g., changes in short-circuit current),
along with considering solar cell parameters (such as base depth and doping level)
and measurement conditions (such as temperature and illumination type), it is possible to predict iron concentration.
One approach to evaluating the value of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ is to apply a machine learning algorithm (random forest, gradient booster, or artificial neural network etc.).
If we assume that the training process is conducted separately for each illumination variant \textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.07,0.00}{ and want to
determine the magnitude of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ based on changes in short-circuit current},
the input set of descriptors could be
($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$).
\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.07,0.00}{Evidently, incorporating additional information, such as changes in efficiency ($\varepsilon \eta$), along with an expanded

However, this should enhance the accuracy of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ predictions.

\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.07,0.00}{This outcome is understandable from a physical standpoint as

\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.07,0.00}{in different descriptor sets, we employed} principal component analysis (PCA),
widely used in solving various problems, including identifying defects in solar cells \cite{Fadhel2019}.
PCA uses a linear combination of the original variables to \textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.07,0.00}{construct} the new variables (principal component, PC) while keeping maximum variance information.
PCs are \textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.07,0.00}{uncorrelated, and PCA allows one to evaluate each PC’s contribution to the total variance of the information.}
In the case of some particular principal component having a low information variance ratio, it can be discarded with little to no loss of useful information.

PCs were built for different combinations of photovoltaic parameters and solar cell characteristics
for the full set of simulated data, and the results are listed in Table~2.
As evident, when only changes in short-circuit current are considered along with the solar cell's base parameters and temperature,
no excessive information is present \textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.07,0.00}{(in the case of the descriptor set ($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$),
all four principal components exhibit a high ratio of information variance)}.

obtained under monochromatic illumination five PCs account for more than 99.5\% of the variance in the input data.
Therefore, applying PCA to transform the seven input variables and using only five is fully justified,
as it significantly simplifies calculations with minimal impact on estimation accuracy.
For the same set of descriptors obtained under AM1.5 illumination,
the number of really independent variables is six.
In general, if the estimation of iron concentration is based on changes in multiple photovoltaic parameters,
it is advisable to apply PCA to transform the original data.
Thus, the simultaneous use of $\varepsilon \eta$ and $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ practically does not alter
the number of independent variables (four) compared to the initial set of descriptors.}
With the additional use of $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ values obtained under AM1.5 illumination, it is advisable to consider five independent variables.
For the same set of descriptors in a monochromatic illumination case, one can limit oneself to using only four independent components
(cumulative variance ratio for PC4 and PC5 does not exceed 1.3\%).

\textcolor[rgb]{0.51,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{Reply:}}


The primary reason doping concentration $N_\mathrm{B}$ influences the sensitivity of photovoltaic
parameters to iron presence is that the $N_\mathrm{B}$ determines the Fermi level $E_\mathrm{F}$ position.
In turn, the rate of Shockley-Read-Hall recombination ---
and consequently, variations in photovoltaic parameters due to iron impurities ---
depends on the relative positioning of $E_\mathrm{F}$ concerning the Fe$_i$B$_s$ and Fe$_i$ levels.
Additionally, the equilibrium ratio of Fe$_i$B$_s$ and Fe$_i$ concentrations is also determined by the Fermi level position \cite{FeB:kinetic,MurphyJAP2011}.
Therefore, $N_\mathrm{B}$ affects the number of defects that change their state due to the complete dissociation of Fe$_i$B$_s$ pairs,
leading to corresponding relative changes in photovoltaic parameters analyzed in this study.
Besides, the $N_\mathrm{B}$ concentration also affects the SCR depth (see Fig.~4 in manuscript).
The ratio of different charge states for both interstitial iron atoms and iron-boron pairs differs between the SCR and the bulk of the base, leading to distinct SRH recombination rates and variations in photovoltaic conversion efficiency for structures with different doping levels.
Furthermore, according to Klaassen’s model \cite{KLAASSEN953},
the concentration of ionized impurities influences charge carrier mobility and, consequently, the diffusion coefficient $D_n$, diffusion length $L_n$,
and photoelectric conversion efficiency (see Eqs.~(4), (5), and (7) in the manuscript).
However, the effect of $N_\mathrm{B}$ via $D_n$ and $L_n$ is significantly weaker than its influence through $E_\mathrm{F}$ and SCR depth variations.
Minor effects are expected as well due to both bandgap narrowing and changes in light absorption by free carriers with varying doping levels.
The impact of doping level on photovoltaic parameters has been studied in heterojunction \cite{Sultana2024},
thin-film \cite{Akila2024},
and perovskite \cite{MasumMia2025} solar cells.
Moreover, it has been shown \cite{Akila2024} that
doping concentration variations affect other barrier structure parameters, such as saturation current and ideality factor.

We employed two key metrics to identify the solar cell parameter whose changes,
resulting from the Fe$_i$B$_\mathrm{Si}$ $\rightleftarrows$ Fe$_i$ + B$_\mathrm{Si}$ reconstruction,
enable the most reliable determination of iron concentration.
Specifically, these metrics are:
(1) the monotonicity of the relative change in the parameter value as a function of impurity concentration,
which is a necessary condition for the unambiguous estimation of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$;
and (2) the absolute magnitude of the parameter change, which allows for more precise measurements and,
consequently, a more accurate estimation of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$.
The first criterion is not satisfied by $\varepsilon F\!F$, $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$, and $\varepsilon \eta$
(the latter two under AM1.5 illumination).
At the same iron concentration, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ values under monochromatic illumination exceed those under AM1.5 illumination.
As mentioned earlier, this effect deals with differences in the generation locations
of non-equilibrium carriers under different lighting conditions.
Additionally, under identical conditions, the changes in open-circuit voltage are significantly weaker
than those in short-circuit current or efficiency.
Since $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ and $\varepsilon \eta$ are of the same order,
it is advisable to select the more reliable parameter using additional metrics.
Notably, short-circuit current determination, unlike efficiency, does not require additional calculations
and can be directly extracted from the raw measured $I$-$V$ curves.
Furthermore, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ is virtually independent of illumination intensity
(whereas $\varepsilon \eta$ exhibits a weak dependence), leading to two key advantages:
(a)~iron concentration can be determined using an uncalibrated for-intensity monochromatic light source;
(b)~the influence of shading caused by electrodes, along with the antireflective and passivating layers of the solar cell, is reduced.

Thus, short-circuit current is the most suitable parameter for estimating the concentration of iron impurities, as its changes during the
Fe$_i$B$_\mathrm{Si}$ $\rightleftarrows$ Fe$_i$ + B$_\mathrm{Si}$ transformation can be effectively utilized.
Determining photovoltaic parameters under monochromatic illumination,
with a wavelength corresponding to the predominant absorption in the solar cell base, is more effective than using AM1.5 illumination.
The most viable alternatives are solar cell efficiency and open-circuit voltage;
however, their applicability is limited at low base doping levels ($<10^{16}$~cm$^{-3}$)
due to non-monotonic variations in response to increasing iron concentration.
In our view, using the fill factor for iron concentration estimation is impractical.
These conclusions are validated by experimental results, which show that short-circuit current provides the most accurate determination of iron concentration.

The limitations of the proposed method may arise from the presence of a significant
number of recombination-active defects unrelated to iron,
as well as high series resistance (which distorts the short-circuit current) and/or shunt resistance (which primarily affects the open-circuit voltage).

The Conclusion has been revised according to the Reviewer's advice --- see page 17, 1st and 2nd paragraph


\begin{mdframed}
The feasibility of using relative changes in short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage,
fill factor, and efficiency resulting from the dissociation of FeB pairs
to estimate the concentration of iron impurities in a solar cell has been analyzed.
\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.07,0.00}{Two key metrics were used to identify the solar cell parameter whose changes,
resulting from the Fe$_i$B$_\mathrm{Si}$ $\rightleftarrows$ Fe$_i$ + B$_\mathrm{Si}$ reconstruction,
enable the most reliable determination of iron concentration.
Specifically, these metrics are:
(1) the monotonicity of the relative change in the parameter value as a function of impurity concentration,
which is a necessary condition for the unambiguous estimation of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$;
and (2) the absolute magnitude of the parameter change, which allows for more precise measurements and,
consequently, a more accurate estimation of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$.
The first criterion is not satisfied by $\varepsilon F\!F$, $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$, and $\varepsilon \eta$
(the latter two under AM1.5 illumination).
At the same iron concentration, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ values under monochromatic illumination exceed those under AM1.5 illumination.
As mentioned earlier, this effect deals with differences in the generation locations
of non-equilibrium carriers under different lighting conditions.
Additionally, under identical conditions, the changes in open-circuit voltage are significantly weaker
than those in short-circuit current or efficiency.
Since $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ and $\varepsilon \eta$ are of the same order,
it is advisable to select the more reliable parameter using additional metrics.
Notably, short-circuit current determination, unlike efficiency, does not require additional calculations
and can be directly extracted from the raw measured $I$-$V$ curves.
Furthermore, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ is virtually independent of illumination intensity
(whereas $\varepsilon \eta$ exhibits a weak dependence), leading to two key advantages:
(a)~iron concentration can be determined using an uncalibrated for-intensity monochromatic light source;
(b)~the influence of shading caused by electrodes, along with the antireflective and passivating layers of the solar cell, is reduced.}

Iron atoms have no beneficial effects on silicon solar cells; 
instead, they act as detrimental impurities that significantly reduce carrier lifetime. 
Despite their harmful impact, iron atoms are among the most common impurities in silicon solar cells. 
Therefore, our study, which examines their effects on solar cell performance under various conditions and lays the foundation for a rapid, non-destructive detection method, holds significant practical value.





Iron is prominent among metallic contaminants, with its atoms being among the most prevalent and detrimental
impurities in silicon solar cells

However, the effect of $N_\mathrm{B}$ via $D_n$ and $L_n$ is significantly weaker than its influence through $E_\mathrm{F}$ and SCR depth variations.
