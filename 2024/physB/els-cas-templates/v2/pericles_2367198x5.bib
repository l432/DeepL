abstract = {n-Type crystalline-silicon (c-Si) photovoltaic (PV) cell modules attract attention because of their potential for achieving high efficiencies. The market share of n-type c-Si PV modules is expected to increase considerably, with wide use in PV systems, including large-scale PV systems, for which the system bias is set as markedly high. Such a high system bias leads to performance losses known as potential-induced degradation (PID). By virtue of many researchersâ€™ efforts, the PID behaviors, mechanisms, and preventive measures against PID have been well documented in conventional p-type c-Si modules. Researchers recently started to investigate PID in high-efficiency c-Si solar cells including n-type c-Si PV modules. Yet, the understanding of PID phenomena remains incomplete. Herein, a literature review of PID in high-efficiency n-type c-Si PV modules is provided as a resource elucidating the current status of related research and remaining unresolved issues. This report mainly presents discussion of PID in several kinds of n-type c-Si PV modules in terms of materials science. PID phenomena are described as divided into some degradation modes. Details present a review of their respective degradation modes, degradation behaviors, proposed mechanisms, and potential measures against degradation. Remaining open issues and anticipated future studies are also summarized.},
