abstract = {Researchers are currently focusing on Silicon (Si)-based solar cells due to their outstanding semiconductor properties. This study aims to enhance the performance of a new Si based solar cell structure of Cu/FTO/CdS/Si/FeSi2/Au and investigate how the inclusion of FeSi2 as a second absorber and CdS buffer layers affects key performance metrics such as VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE using SCAPS-1D simulation. Various factors including thickness, carrier concentration, defect density, temperature, and electrode design were analyzed in detail to improve performance. The PCE, VOC, JSC, and FF have shown 25.2 %, 0.718 V, 43.3 mA/cm2, and 80.8 %, respectively with reference structure's (Cu/FTO/CdS/Si/Au). The PCE, VOC, JSC, and FF have improved to 27.73 %, 0.74 V, 45.55 mA/cm2, and 79.94 %, respectively by adding FeSi2 layer as a bottom absorber with proposed structures (Cu/FTO/CdS/Si/FeSi2/Au). This research has the potential to offer insights and strategies for the development of cost-effective Si-based thin-film solar cells in a near future.}
