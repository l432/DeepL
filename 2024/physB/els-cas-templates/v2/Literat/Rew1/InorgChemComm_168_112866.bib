abstract = {In this groundbreaking study, we successfully synthesized both cerium oxide and copper indium sulphate nanoparticles via co-precipitation method and the same is spray coated on ITO substrate by Jet Nebulizer Spray Pyrolysis (JNSP) technique. A comprehensive characterization of the structural, morphological and Photo-diode properties was conducted using a range of advanced techniques. X-ray diffraction revealed a superior mono-crystalline cubic fluorite structure with a preferred orientation along the (111) plane, indicating exceptional crystal quality. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images showed the formation of disk-shaped particles with sharp rounded edges, averaging ∼ 5 nm in size. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy identified the phonon band envelope of the metal oxide (CeO2) network at 848 cm−1 while photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed blue and blue-green emission in the visible spectrum. Thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis exhibited a total weight loss of 19.52 % with four distinct exothermic and endothermic peaks. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of Ce and O elements, with a minor amount of carbon absorbed from the atmosphere and revealed the dominant occurrence of Ce4+ and minority occurrence of Ce3+. The maximum power conversion efficiency of 0.23 % was achieved for samples prepared using NH3 precipitant making them highly suitable for photovoltaic applications. This work paves the way for future research in optimizing cerium oxide nanoparticles for high-performance photovoltaic devices potentially leading to breakthroughs in renewable energy harvesting.}
