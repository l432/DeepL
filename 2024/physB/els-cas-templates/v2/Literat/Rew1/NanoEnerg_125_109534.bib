abstract = {In this review, we explore the last fifty years of Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor (MIS) Schottky barrier diode research, highlighting a surge in interest in tailored filaments for thin films, photovoltaic cells, and advanced electronics. The fundamental principles of MIS functionalization on the intermediate insulator layer within the MIS structure are detailed, followed by a comprehensive discussion of approaches to MIS-based diode fabrication, meticulously addressing specific details of metal, insulator and semiconductor layers. This review delves into bespoke device manufacturing methods, underscoring their significance in the scientific landscape. It examines principal materials used in production, focusing on optical,Â electrical applications explores the evolution of insulating materials, doping effects, manufacturing technologies and potential device applications. Challenges in MIS diode manufacturing are outlined, exploring various techniques, their advantages and disadvantages. JNSP thin film coating emerges as a preferred technique due to its cost-effectiveness, ease of handling, and non-toxic nature. From our comprehensive review, it is evident that transition metals are preferred materials in previous research. The article concludes by addressing future perspectives, guiding novel advancements and contemplating applications of bespoke filaments in optoelectronic devices and applications. This holistic exploration aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse and evolution of MIS-based devices across diverse fields.}
