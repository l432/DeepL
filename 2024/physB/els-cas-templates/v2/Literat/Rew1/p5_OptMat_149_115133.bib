abstract = {In the current investigation, we are fabricated the Schottky barrier diode (SBDs) formed on dual doped Ce-(Sn:Cd) (1, 3 and 5 wt%) thin films. The film was prepared by spray pyrolysis of transparent glass and silicon substrates using a low-cost nebulizer, ideal substrate temperature is 450 °C and the structure, optics, morphology & electrical properties of the films were characterized by X-Ray Diffractometer, Atomic Force Microscope and Ultra Violet - Visible spectral, electrical and I–V properties of diodes. All dual doped thin films are the cubic structure, as revealed by the XRD pattern. Then the roughness and smoothness of the film were then revealed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Ultraviolet–vis spectroscopy is formed on optical absorption and band gap energy (3.91 eV) also electrical conductivity increases Cd concentration of films corresponding activation energy diminish. Current-voltage properties [I–V] and photodiode parameters of Cu/Ce-(Sn:Cd)/n-Si diodes were evaluated in the dark and light. The barrier height (ФB) for the diode fabricated was initiate to be 0.69 eV, as well as ideality factors (n) 2.57 of the diode parameters. As a consequence, the 5 wt% of Cd parade greater device performance for the photodiode applications, the present study is first combination of dual doped samples and low cost JNSP technique.}
