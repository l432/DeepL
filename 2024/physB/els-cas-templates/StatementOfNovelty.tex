\section*{Statement of Novelty}

The impact of FeB pair dissociation on the photovoltaic parameters of silicon solar cells was examined.
Unlike previous similar calculations, 
1)~the paper presents the results of
simulation of solar cell with varying base thickness and doping levels
under various external conditions (temperature, intensity, and spectral composition of illumination);
2)~in addition to analyzing the ability to use photovoltaic parameter changes induced by iron-related defect 
restructuring to evaluate iron concentration, 
principal component analysis was used to estimate the number of independent variables in the multiple photovoltaic parameter set.
