Modeling the Impact of Iron Defect Variability on Silicon Solar Cell Performance Across Different Scenarios

Transitioning to renewable energy sources is paramount for humanity's sustainable development, and silicon solar cells are at the forefront of solar energy conversion. Iron in these structures is a primary one of the most detrimental metallic impurities. This study examines the impact of iron defect variability on silicon solar cell performance across various scenarios. We have simulated solar cells using SCAPS software across a range of temperatures (290-340) K, base thicknesses (180-380) μm, doping levels (1015 - 1017) cm-3, with iron concentrations varying from 1010 to 1014 cm-3 under AM1.5 and monochromatic (940 nm) illumination. Analyzed across all cases were the effects of iron-boron pair dissociation on short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, fill factor, and efficiency. The experimental measurements validated the simulation results, demonstrating good agreement for all photovoltaic parameters. This study investigates the potential of using photovoltaic parameter changes induced by iron-related defect restructuring to estimate iron concentration. It is shown that changes in short-circuit current obtained under monochromatic illumination are the most reliable, while the fill factor is the least effective. Principal component analysis was used to estimate the number of independent variables when multiple photovoltaic parameters are used simultaneously.


Abstract 150 word

The impact of FeB pair dissociation on the current-voltage characteristics of silicon solar cells was examined. Solar cells were simulated by using SCAPS software across a range of temperatures (290-340) K, base thicknesses (180-380) $\mu$m, doping levels (10^15 - 10^17) cm^-3, with iron concentrations varying from 10^10 to 10^14 cm^-3 under AM1.5 and monochromatic (940 nm) illumination. The effects of iron-boron pair dissociation on short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, fill factor, and efficiency were analyzed across all cases. The experimental measurements validated the simulation results, demonstrating a good agreement for all photovoltaic parameters. The ability to use photovoltaic parameter changes induced by iron-related defect restructuring to estimate iron concentration was analyzed. It is shown that changes in short-circuit current obtained under monochromatic illumination are the most reliable. Principal component analysis was used to estimate the number of independent variables when multiple photovoltaic parameters are used simultaneously.

Statement of Novelty
80-100 word

The impact of FeB pair dissociation on the photovoltaic parameters of silicon solar cells was examined.
Unlike previous similar calculations, 
1)~the paper presents the results of
simulation of solar cell with varying base thickness and doping levels
under various external conditions (temperature, intensity, and spectral composition of illumination);
2)~in addition to analyzing the ability to use photovoltaic parameter changes induced by iron-related defect 
restructuring to evaluate iron concentration, 
principal component analysis was used to estimate the number of independent variables in the multiple photovoltaic parameter set.
