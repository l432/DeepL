abstract = {In this work, we have investigated the impact of interstitial Fe contamination on the effective minority carrier lifetime of n-type Cz silicon bulk material for high efficiency solar cells. The study covers a Fe concentration in the silicon bulk from 3.5 × 1012 cm-3 to 2.7 × 1014cm-3. We have added 5 different concentrations (30, 100, 300, 1000 and 3000 ppb) of Fe intentionally to a wet chemical process tank and measured the transfer to the silicon wafer surface mimicking a possible contamination during wet chemical processing. In order to fabricate carrier lifetime test vehicles, the silicon wafer is then passivated with thermal silicon oxide from both sides. The surface contamination is driven into the bulk by mimicking a high temperature process during solar cell manufacturing. Effective minority carrier lifetime is measured at injection levels from 1 × 1013 cm-3 to 3 × 1015cm-3. We have fitted the theoretical curve for interstitial Fe derived from the SRH theory to the measured values and extracted the Fe contamination concentration. This value is comparable to the calculated value extracted from the surface contamination measurement. For low level injection (LLI), we extracted the capture cross section for interstitial Fe to be 6.45 × 10-17 cm/s ± 2.23 × 10-17 cm/s. The measured Fe contamination levels are used for the conversion efficiency fitting of a n-type bifacial silicon solar cell using QUOKKA simulations. The simulations show that very low Fe contamination concentrations of [Fe]bulk = 3.5 × 1012 cm-3 ([Fe]surf = 6 × 1010cm-2) already degrade the solar cell efficiency by 10% relative.}
