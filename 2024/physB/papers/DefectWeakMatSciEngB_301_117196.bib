abstract = {Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been widely studied due to their outstanding photovoltaic (PV) performance. However, carrier recombination in perovskite is one of the main factors limiting their PV performance. Here, by constructing a p-type MAPbI3/n-type MAPbI3 (MAPbI3(p)/MAPbI3(n)) homojunction using SCAPS-1D, an electric field was created inside the homojunction to reduce the recombination of photogenerated carriers, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased from 13.82 % to 19.14 %. Besides, the effects of the doping concentration of MAPbI3(n) and MAPbI3(p) on PV performance were explored. A PCE of 19.98 % was reached at the optimal doping concentration. Finally, the influences of the thickness of MAPbI3(n) and MAPbI3(p) on the PV performance were investigated, and a PCE of 22.00 % was achieved when the thickness of MAPbI3(n) and MAPbI3(p) were 0.45 and 2.25 µm, respectively. This work provides a strategy for constructing perovskite homojunction for highly efficient PSCs.}
