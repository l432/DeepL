abstract = {In this work, the SCAPS-1D program was used to develop and simulate Al-ZnO/CdS/CZTS/MoS2/Mo conventional solar cell structure. We enhanced numerous parameters, including CZTS thickness, MoS2 interlayer thickness, and carrier concentration, after device validation using experimental results. With a Voc of 0.81 V, Jsc of 16.83 mA/cm2, and FF of 65.84 %, the highest experimental efficiency is 8.98%. However, we found that low efficiency is caused by defect density and the formation of MoS2 interlayers, both of which are generated by high recombination. In order to minimize this recombination, we proposed employing MoOx as the back-surface field and “Au” as the bottom contact. After device adjustment, a high performance of 22.28 % was achieved employing 20 nm of MoOx and a CZTS defect concentration of 1013 cm−3 in the new Al-ZnO/CdS/CZTS/MoOx/Au solar cell.}
