abstract = {Perovskite solar cells have become the main source of attraction among photovoltaic researchers since its inception in 2009 due to their steady enhancement in efficiency and cost-effective fabrication methodologies. The integration of the concept of multijunction or tandem technology with Perovskite solar cells is considered to be one of the best substitutes for designing efficient Solar Cells. Recently, the perovskite/silicon tandem architecture possesses tremendous research potential owing to their capability to generate competitive efficiencies. In this research article, we have analysed the optoelectronic properties of CsGeI3 with the WIEN2K tool for first principle computations through the density functional theory methodology. The bandgap of CsGeI3 is found out to be 1.6 eV. Calculated bandgap and absorption coefficient spectra are used as input parameters for device simulation using the SCAPS-1D tool. Environment-friendly CsGeI3 and c-Si are used as top cell and bottom cell absorbers respectively with the two cells connected in series with an ITO interconnecting layer for the proposed tandem solar cell architecture. Under current matching scenario and AM 1.5G spectrum illumination, the standalone top cell shows PCE of 18.31 %, Voc ∼1.20 V, Jsc ∼17.55 mA/cm2 and FF ∼86.42 % for 265 nm thick CsGeI3 layer, while bottom cell when subjected to the spectrum transmitted by top cell, provided a PCE of 10.15 % with Voc∼ 0.703 V, Jsc ∼17.50 mA/cm2 and FF ∼82.62 % with 400 μm thick c-Si absorber. Before being implemented in the tandem configuration, simulated J-V characteristics of both top and bottom cells are calibrated to show close agreement with the experimental results. The two-terminal tandem device demonstrates an improved PCE of 28.43 %, FF of 84.90 %, Jsc of 17.55 mA/cm2, and Voc of 1.90 V. The effect of Rs and Rsh and the interfacial and bulk defect states on the photovoltaic parameters (PCE, FF Jsc, and Voc) is also analysed. Finally, a semi-analytical model is used to validate the J-V characteristics of the tandem architecture obtained with SCAPS-1D simulator using an equivalent circuit model of two series-connected diodes. This study can open new directions for the design of eco-friendly lead-free perovskite/c-Si based tandem devices with superior photovoltaic characteristics.}
