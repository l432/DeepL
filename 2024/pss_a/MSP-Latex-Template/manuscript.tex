\section{Introduction}

Defects significantly impact semiconductor properties.
Although minimizing device dimensions to nanometers shifts some focus from extensive to point defects,
physical properties still rely heavily on the presence and distribution of these irregularities.
Hence, many strategies for enhancing semiconductor structures, including radiation and temperature treatments or certain fabrication conditions, strive to decrease the defect concentration or neutralize its effects \cite{Cai2023,Vobecky2021,Frascaroli2021}.
For instance, in the case of photovoltaic devices, we must understand and optimize the carrier properties tied to defects and impurities  \cite{Cai2023}.
Such controlled alteration methods of the defective subsystem have been generalized under the term ``defect engineering'' and are extremely important from a practical standpoint.

Successful defect engineering hinges on an in-depth understanding of defect properties.
Key factors are defect formation energy, transition energy levels, self-compensating effects, nonradiative recombination caused by defects, 
and the mechanism of reconstruction and diffusion  \cite{Cai2023}.
Considering the extraordinary diversity of possible intrinsic and impurity defects, complete information on all of them is lacking even for silicon, which is the most studied semiconductor.
Nevertheless, it must be noted that considerable data have been amassed on silicon, and have a solid understanding of some defects \cite{Juhl2018}.

For instance, such defects are iron impurity, a common, detrimental, and often unavoidable contaminant 
in photovoltaic silicon \cite{Frascaroli2021,Sun2021}, and iron-boron pair.
Specifically, iron atoms are known to be at the interstitial sites, and Fe$_i^+$ are highly efficient recombination centers \cite{WeberFe}.
In p-type Si at room temperature, iron atoms are almost predominantly bound in complexes with dopants (B, Ga, Al, In).
This defect demonstrates bistable behavior: the stable state is defined by the configuration in which the Fe occupies 
the first nearest tetrahedral interstitial site closest to the substituent atom,  
whereas, in the metastable configuration, Fe is at the second $T_d$ interstitial site \cite{FeB:PhysRevB49}.
The energy levels associated with iron and its complexes, as well as the respective carriers capture cross-sections, are well-established \cite{Juhl2018,ROUGIEUX2018}.
Among the acceptor-iron pairs, the complex FeB is the most thoroughly investigated, 
primarily due to the widespread use of Si:B in the fabrication of various devices, such as solar cells. 
However, it is worth mentioning that gallium is gaining increasing attention as an acceptor dopant whose incorporation, 
for instance, can help mitigate the light and elevated temperature-induced degradation \cite{Ning2022}.

It is known that
FeB pairs can be dissociated by illumination, minority carrier injection and thermal treatment at 200~$^\circ$ \cite{FeBAssJAP2014}.
