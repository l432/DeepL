Dear Dr. Gopal,

Firstly, excuse me for long time reply.
The vacation is a reason.

The sent analysis result are interesting, but I have some comments.
See blue text in "analysis of the data_Responce.docx"-file.

Unfortunately, the reverse  bias characteristics of these solar cells were not measured.
Test mesurements  shown that reverse characteristics have been influenced by shunt resistance considerably.
Therefore detailed investigation was not carried out.

With best regards,

Oleg Olikh
