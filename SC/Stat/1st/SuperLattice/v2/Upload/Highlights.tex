\textbf{Highlights:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Ultrasound loading leads to reversible degradation of the silicon solar sells
  \item The ultrasound--induced degradation is intensified in the case of the transverse acoustic waves using
  \item Degradation is caused by the acoustically induced increase in the carrier capture coefficient for point and extended defects
\end{itemize}
