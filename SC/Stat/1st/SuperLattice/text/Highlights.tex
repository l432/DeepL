\textbf{Highlights:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Ultrasound loading leads to reversible degradation of the silicon solar sells
  \item Acoustically induced change of the current-voltage characteristics is determined by lattice atom
displacement 
  \item Degradation is caused by the acoustically induced increase in the carrier capture coefficient for point and extended defects
\end{itemize}
