Dear Dr. Nakamae,

I am pleased to read your letter about EU-MACE.
Of course, I have already heard a little about this COST-initiative
from Prof. Isaiev.  However, I learned some more details with interest.

In my opinion, it is a viable R&D approach. Therefore, I would be very interested in taking part in this project. The new class of material will be an exciting challenge to our methodology.
My agreement is facilitated by the fact that I have only a very general idea of the task. The most general tasks seem to be the easiest. But seriously, the opportunities to exchange with other research groups appear very important.

The Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv is interested in international projects, including the ERASMUS program. Some difficulty can only arise with quick document preparation. First, we have a powerful bureaucratic apparatus (ask Prof. Isaiev). Second, it is a cursed war.

Thank you once again for the invitation to join the team. I hope that our group's activity will be helpful.

With my best regards,
 
Oleg

Dear Dr. Nakamae,

I read the project proposal draft with great interest. It looks prospectively.

I have accepted the invitation to join the Network of Proposers of the COST Action Proposal OC-2022-1-25868 " European Material Acceleration Center for Energy" on October 13.
The file “expertise” is attached.

With my best regards,
Oleg

Dear Saco,

 

I trust this message finds you well.

Everything is fine. Better late than never.

I'm writing to provide an update on my progress. I have completed the Apply form, selecting the "New Materials" Working Group as my preference. Additionally, I have sent an e-mail to the national contact point about the MC member role.

I hope we won't be late.

 

 

With my best regards,

Oleg

Dear Saco,

 
I apologize for not writing sooner.

I finally managed to get in touch with the national contact point, after several emails and a phone call. On Wednesday, I completed the application and submitted my CV. I am hopeful that the process will proceed smoothly. However, I must admit that I am not entirely clear on the indicators of necessary changes in the application status. The application on the website https://e-services.cost.eu remains unchanged, and there are no new names appearing in the Management Committee list (https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA22123/#tabs+Name:Management%20Committee).

Thank you for your ongoing support and guidance.

With my best regards,

Oleg

Наскільки я зрозумів, я став MC member:
в кабінеті на сайті https://e-services.cost.eu я бачу всі Working Group applications;
крім того, я отримав Invitation to "CA22123 1st Management Committee meeting".

На превеликий жаль, я не зможу бути присутнім на зустрічі.
У нас в країні військовий стан, я є військозобов'язаний і не можу вільно залишати кордони країни.
Отримати дозвіл можливо (але немає гарантії), проте підготовка документів займає близько місяця.
Я просто не встигну до 3 жовтня.
Можливо, якщо бути он-лайн варіант участі у зустрічі, я зможу ним скористатися.

Сподіваюсь, що на наступні зустрічі я зможу потрапити, почавши підготовку документів заздалегідь.

ще раз дякую за запрошення приєднатися до COST Action.
Я впевнений, що це буде чудовий досвід.
 
Dear Saco,

I have received notification of my MC membership, and I have access to all Working Group applications on the e-services.cost.eu portal. 
Additionally, I received the Invitation to the "CA22123 1st Management Committee Meeting."

Regrettably, I must convey my disappointment in not being able to attend this inaugural meeting in person. Currently, my country is under a state of military mobilization, and I am a conscripted member of the armed forces. Consequently, I am unable to freely leave the country's borders. While obtaining permission for international travel is possible, it entails a lengthy administrative process that typically takes around a month to complete. Unfortunately, this timeframe does not align with the scheduled meeting date of October 3rd.
Perhaps, if there is an online option to participate in the meeting, I will be able to take advantage of it.

I hope that for our future meetings, I will be able to attend by starting to prepare the documents in advance.

Once again, thank you for extending the invitation to join the CA22123 COST Action. I am confident that this experience will be both rewarding and impactful, and I look forward to collaborating with the esteemed members of the Management Committee and Working Groups in the near future.

With my best regards,
Oleg
