Dear Dr. Nakamae,

I am pleased to read your letter about EU-MACE.
Of course, I have already heard a little about this COST-initiative
from Prof. Isaiev.  However, I learned some more details with interest.

In my opinion, it is a viable R&D approach. Therefore, I would be very interested in taking part in this project. The new class of material will be an exciting challenge to our methodology.
My agreement is facilitated by the fact that I have only a very general idea of the task. The most general tasks seem to be the easiest. But seriously, the opportunities to exchange with other research groups appear very important.

The Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv is interested in international projects, including the ERASMUS program. Some difficulty can only arise with quick document preparation. First, we have a powerful bureaucratic apparatus (ask Prof. Isaiev). Second, it is a cursed war.

Thank you once again for the invitation to join the team. I hope that our group's activity will be helpful.

With my best regards,
 
Oleg
