Dear Dr. Nakamae,

I am pleased to read your letter about EU-MACE.
Of course, I have already heard a little about this COST-initiative
from Prof. Isaiev.  However, I learned some more details with interest.

In my opinion, it is a viable R&D approach. Therefore, I would be very interested in taking part in this project. The new class of material will be an exciting challenge to our methodology.
My agreement is facilitated by the fact that I have only a very general idea of the task. The most general tasks seem to be the easiest. But seriously, the opportunities to exchange with other research groups appear very important.

The Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv is interested in international projects, including the ERASMUS program. Some difficulty can only arise with quick document preparation. First, we have a powerful bureaucratic apparatus (ask Prof. Isaiev). Second, it is a cursed war.

Thank you once again for the invitation to join the team. I hope that our group's activity will be helpful.

With my best regards,
 
Oleg

Dear Dr. Nakamae,

I read the project proposal draft with great interest. It looks prospectively.

The file “expertise” is attached.

With my best regards,

Dear Saco,

 

I trust this message finds you well.

Everything is fine. Better late than never.

I'm writing to provide an update on my progress. I have completed the Apply form, selecting the "New Materials" Working Group as my preference. Additionally, I have sent an e-mail to the national contact point about the MC member role.

I hope we won't be late.

 

 

With my best regards,

Oleg

Dear Saco,

 
I apologize for not writing sooner.

I finally managed to get in touch with the national contact point, after several emails and a phone call. On Wednesday, I completed the application and submitted my CV. I am hopeful that the process will proceed smoothly. However, I must admit that I am not entirely clear on the indicators of necessary changes in the application status. The application on the website https://e-services.cost.eu remains unchanged, and there are no new names appearing in the Management Committee list (https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA22123/#tabs+Name:Management%20Committee).

Thank you for your ongoing support and guidance.

With my best regards,

Oleg
