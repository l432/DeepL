reimbursement


Dear Grant Holder Manager,

My name is Oleh Olikh, and I am a professor at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (Ukraine). Additionally, I serve as a Management Committee Member of COST Action "European Materials Acceleration Center for Energy" (EU-MACE) CA22123. On January 24-25, 2023, I participated in the 2nd MC meeting and joint workshop on "Digitalisation and Automations Boost Materials Research". Relevant documents were uploaded on January 27 (see attachment).

I would like to inquire about the timeline for receiving reimbursement for expenses related to my participation in this event, in accordance with the COST Rules of Reimbursement (https://www.cost.eu/travel_reimbursement_rules/).

I've heard that other participants of the COST Action have already received reimbursement a week ago. Perhaps I need to upload additional documents to receive my funds.

Best regards,
Oleg Oleh

Я чув, що інші учасники COST Action вже отримали відшкодування тиждень назад. Можливо, мені потрібно завантажити ще якісь документи щоб отримати мої кошти.
