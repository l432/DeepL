Based on our expertise, we are particularly interested in the following topics:
- Novel approaches towards next-generation battery concepts, leveraging the enabling role of innovative advanced materials (BATT4EU and IAM4EU Partnerships)
- New advanced materials and production processes Ц reducing dependencies on Critical and Strategic Raw Materials (IA) (Innovative Advanced Materials for the EU, Processes4Planet partnerships)
- Accelerating the discovery of chemicals and advanced materials through artificial intelligence and digitalisation (IA) (IAM4EU partnership)

Our group specializes in molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the mechanical and thermal properties of nanostructures and phase-change composites. This expertise can significantly contribute to the proposed calls in the following ways:
- Next-generation battery materials: We can provide atomic-scale insight into the thermal and mechanical stability and structural integrity of novel electrode materials. MD modelling helps identify degradation pathways and design strategies for improved performance and lifetime.
- Critical Raw Materials replacement: We can model the thermomechanical and transport behavior of advanced composites or nanostructured substitutes for critical raw materials, thus supporting efforts to reduce EU dependencies.
- Digitalisation & AI-driven discovery: Our MD simulation data can serve as a training basis for machine learning workflows, accelerating the discovery of new functional materials with tailored mechanical and thermal performance.
