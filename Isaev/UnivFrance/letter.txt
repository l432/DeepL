The main research topic is the application of ultrasound to characterize and modify the properties of semiconductor structures, in particular solar cells. For the first time, the charge transfer was investigated in silicon p-n and Schottky structures under ultrasound loading conditions, and the model of acoustically active complex defect is proposed. As well, the researches deal with the determination of barrier structure parameters from current-voltage, capacity-voltage, and impedance spectroscopy measurements by using the metaheuristic methods. Besides, the machine learning approach for estimating the concentration of electrically active centers in barrier structures is developing.
