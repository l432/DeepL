\emph{The introduction lacks the role of iron valency (ferrous or ferric) in silicon solar cells.}

\noindent
\textcolor[rgb]{0.51,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{Reply:}}

Reviewer is correct that ferrous (Fe$^{2+}$) and ferric (Fe$^{3+}$) states deserve consideration,
as they are the most common and stable charge states of iron.
These ionic forms typically occur in compounds where iron forms chemical bonds (either ionic or covalent) with other elements,
as well as in cases where iron is present as an impurity in solid materials.
In silicon, iron can also exist in a trivalent (ferric) state when it substitutes for a silicon atom at a lattice site.
However, under normal conditions, the concentration of substitutional iron is extremely low, less than 1\% of the total iron impurity atoms \cite{Wright2016}.
Increasing the concentration of substitutional iron requires special sample processing, such as high-temperature annealing or irradiation.
Moreover, substitutional iron acts as a weak recombination center,
so its influence on the properties of silicon solar cells can be neglected.
The ferrous form is virtually absent in silicon.
The majority of iron impurity atoms in silicon occupy positions,
where they can exist in either a neutral (Fe$_i^0$) or positively charged (Fe$_i^+$) state,
depending on the position of the Fermi level \cite{Istratov1999}.
In $n$-type silicon,Fe$_i$ is more likely to exist in a neutral state,
whereas in $p$-type silicon, it is more likely to be positively charged.
Even when interstitial iron forms complex point defects, such as iron–boron pairs (Fe$_i$B$_s$), no valence bonds are formed.
In interstitial configuration, iron acts as an active recombination center.

Consequently, in silicon solar cells, the role of iron valence is negligible,
in contrast to other types of solar cells, such as perovskite solar cells \cite{Poindexter2017}.
Specifically, in MAPbI$_3$-based devices, both Fe$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{2+}$  point defects are observed,
with Fe$^{3+}$ being electronically inactive in terms of recombination.

We have added the relevant information to the Introduction (page 2, third paragraph from the top).

\emph{The work didn't deal with the redox reaction of iron in silicon solar cells.}

\noindent
\textcolor[rgb]{0.51,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{Reply:}}

Initially, it is important to note that
redox reactions do not play a central role in silicon solar cells,
unlike dye-sensitized solar cells or photoelectrochemical cells.
However, changes in the charge states of individual atoms --- whether intrinsic or impurity-related ---
occur during the photoelectric conversion process.
For example, during the recombination of charge carriers at iron-related defects
(such as interstitial iron atoms or iron-boron pairs),
electron capture occurs in the initial stage:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \mathrm{Fe}_i^++e^-&\rightarrow& \mathrm{Fe}_i^0\,, \\
  (\mathrm{Fe_iB_s})^0+e^-&\rightarrow& (\mathrm{Fe_iB_s})^-\,,
\end{eqnarray*}
which typically corresponds to a reduction reaction.
In the subsequent stage, hole capture alters the defect's charge state again
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \mathrm{Fe}_i^0+h^+&\rightarrow& \mathrm{Fe}_i^+\,, \\
  (\mathrm{Fe_iB_s})^-+h^+&\rightarrow& (\mathrm{Fe_iB_s})^0\,,
\end{eqnarray*}
formally representing an oxidation reaction.
When FeB pairs dissociate due to intense illumination, electron injection, or heating up to 200~$^\circ$C,
the iron atom becomes neutral by capturing an electron (reduction) during the first step of this two-stage process.
After dissociation and the cessation of the external stimulus,
the interstitial iron atom loses an electron (oxidation),
becoming singly positively charged, which allows it to re-form a pair with a negatively charged dopant (boron).
However, transitions between different charge states of iron-related defects in silicon
are governed by electron and hole capture and emission processes,
involving the exchange of carriers between the defect levels and the conduction or valence band.
These processes are described within Shockley–Read–Hall theory
and do not constitute redox reactions in the classical chemical sense.

Consequently, the original manuscript did not emphasize redox reactions of iron in silicon solar cells,
and the Reviewer’s observation is valid.
In the revised manuscript, we have included a note on the distinct nature of charge-state transitions in iron-related defects,
highlighting how they differ from classical redox reactions (page 2, fourth paragraph from the top).

\emph{Why temperature range (290-340)~K?
what was the dissociation efficiency of FeB pairs at this temperature?
How much is translated to cell degradation?
Since at this temperature range, other factors also go side on that impact device characteristic.}


\noindent
\textcolor[rgb]{0.51,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{Reply:}}

We hope that the proposed approach will be applied to evaluate the concentration of iron in already installed solar modules
and during the certification of photovoltaic converters.
On the one hand, the selected temperature range of 290–340~K reflects the typical operating conditions of most silicon solar cells.
On the other hand, the IEC 61215-2:2021 \cite{IEC61215} standard requires that temperature coefficients of
short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, and maximum power be determined based on current–voltage measurements conducted
within a temperature range of approximately +15~$^\circ$C to +75~$^\circ$C (288–348~K).
In other words, the standard solar cell testing results can serve as input data for machine learning models trained within selected temperature range.

Additional information justifying the choice of temperature range has been added in the revised manuscript (page 4, first paragraph).


Complete dissociation of the FeB pairs was achieved during experiments conducted within the specified temperature range
(further clarified below in response to the following Reviewer's comment).


The changes in photovoltaic parameter values resulting from FeB pair dissociation depend on 
both the concentration of iron impurities and the solar cell parameters 
(such as base thickness and dopant concentration), 
as well as the measurement conditions (illumination intensity and spectral composition, temperature). 
This issue is discussed in more detail in \cite{Olikh2025MSEB}, 
which presents the results of silicon solar cell modeling used to create the training dataset.
For instance, under AM1.5 illumination, the relative changes in short-circuit current range 
from $-40.88$\% 
(for $N_\mathrm{B}=10^{17}$~cm$^{-3}$, $T=290$~K, $d_p=380$~$\mu$m) 
to 6.11\% 
(for $N_\mathrm{B}=10^{15}$~cm$^{-3}$, $T=315$~K, $d_p=380$~$\mu$m). 
Similarly, the relative changes in open-circuit voltage vary from 
$-12.95$\%
(for $N_\mathrm{B}=10^{15}$~cm$^{-3}$, $T=340$~K, $d_p=180$~$\mu$m) 
to 1.92\% 
(for $N_\mathrm{B}=1.778\times10^{15}$~cm$^{-3}$, $T=340$~K, $d_p=230$~$\mu$m).
Notably, the most pronounced changes in solar cell characteristics do not necessarily occur at the highest iron concentrations. 
For example, the maximum negative change in open-circuit voltage ($-12.95$\%) 
is observed at an iron concentration of $3.162\times10^{12}$~cm$^{-3}$, 
rather than at the highest tested level.

This suggests that FeB pair dissociation, depending on the specific parameters, 
can not only degrade solar cell performance but also improve certain characteristics \cite{Olikh2025MSEB,FeB:Schmidt}.
However, it is important to emphasize that light-induced dissociation of FeB pairs does not lead to irreversible changes in photovoltaic parameters. 
Once the illumination ceases, the FeB pairs re-form, and the solar cell characteristics return to their original values \cite{FeBLight2,FeBAssJAP2014,FeBKin2019,FeMethod2012,FeBLight2,FeBAssJAP2014}.


Information regarding the ranges of changes in photovoltaic parameters and their reversibility has been added to the revised manuscript
(page 4, third paragraph from the top; page 3, first paragraph in Section~2.1).

We fully agree with the Reviewer that, within the chosen temperature range, 
factors beyond iron concentration and the selected descriptors may also influence solar cell characteristics. 
This is especially relevant for real solar cells, which, in addition to iron, 
may contain other recombination-active impurities. 
To better isolate iron-related effects from the influence of other factors, 
we used relative changes in PV parameters as model inputs. 
Since models trained in this way provided sufficiently accurate predictions of iron concentration from 
both simulated and experimentally measured current–voltage characteristics, we consider this approach well justified.

\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.50,1.00}{\textbf{Comment~2.}}
\emph{Complete details about the dissociation of FeB pairs using halogen lamp illumination? What was the time duration? How much was the decay efficiency.}

\noindent
\textcolor[rgb]{0.51,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{Reply:}}

It is known \cite{Macdonald2004} that strong optical illumination ($>$100~W/m$^{2}$)
results in almost complete (>99\%) dissociation of the FeB pairs.
The dissociation rate $R_d$ is influenced by the pair concentration $N_\mathrm{FeB}$ and overall carrier generation rate $G$, which is proportional to the illumination intensity
\cite{FeBLight2,FeBAssJAP2014,FeBKin2019,FeMethod2012}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqRd}
R_d=K\left(\frac{G}{N_\mathrm{FeB}}\right)^2\,,
\end{equation}
where
$K$ is the constant of the material.
Additionally, it is well established that $R_d$ depends on temperature \cite{Lagowskii1993,lauer2016},
the spectral composition of illumination \cite{OlikhPSSA},
and the presence of recombination channels other than those associated with iron-related defects \cite{FeBLight2,FeBAssJAP2014}.

For experimental validation of the proposed models, samples with an iron concentration of $2\times10^{11}$ to $4\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$ were used.
Dissociation of FeB pairs was induced by intense illumination from a halogen lamp (7000~W/m$^{2}$).
The illumination duration required to achieve near-complete dissociation depended on the iron concentration
and reached up to 400~s for the solar cell with the highest $N_\mathrm{FeB}$ values.
When selecting the illumination intervals, we considered the results of a previous study \cite{OlikhPSSA},
which showed that in samples with a similar defect composition and exposed to a comparable light source,
complete dissociation at $N_\mathrm{Fe}=9\times10^{12}$~cm$^{-3}$ occurred within 20~s.

Details regarding the selection of the illumination duration can be found on page 3 (last paragraph).

\emph{Most of the models significantly fail for the AM1.5 illumination? What could be the reason for that?}

\noindent
\textcolor[rgb]{0.51,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{Reply:}}


Two key metrics were used to identify the solar cell parameter whose changes,
resulting from the Fe$_i$B$_\mathrm{Si}$ $\rightleftarrows$ Fe$_i$ + B$_\mathrm{Si}$ reconstruction,
enable the most reliable determination of iron concentration.
Specifically, these metrics are:
(1) the monotonicity of the relative change in the parameter value as a function of impurity concentration,
which is a necessary condition for the unambiguous estimation of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$;
and (2) the absolute magnitude of the parameter change, which allows for more precise measurements and,
consequently, a more accurate estimation of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$.
The first criterion is not satisfied by $\varepsilon F\!F$, $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$, and $\varepsilon \eta$
(the latter two under AM1.5 illumination).
At the same iron concentration, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ values under monochromatic illumination exceed those under AM1.5 illumination.
As mentioned earlier, this effect deals with differences in the generation locations
of non-equilibrium carriers under different lighting conditions.
Additionally, under identical conditions, the changes in open-circuit voltage are significantly weaker
than those in short-circuit current or efficiency.
Since $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ and $\varepsilon \eta$ are of the same order,
it is advisable to select the more reliable parameter using additional metrics.

\end{figure}


The reduced accuracy of most models under AM1.5 illumination likely results from the increased complexity of the broadband solar spectrum compared to monochromatic light.
Under AM1.5, the photovoltaic parameter changes are influenced by a wider range of physical effects and interactions, making the relationship between input features and iron concentration more complex and less direct.
This complexity makes it more challenging for many models-especially simpler ones-to generalize well, even when trained on simulated data.
In contrast, monochromatic illumination provides a more straightforward correlation between iron-related recombination and PV parameter changes, resulting in higher model accuracy.

%The notably poor performance of the SVR model in our results is likely due to its limited ability to capture the complex, highly non-linear relationships between the input features (such as relative changes in PV parameters, temperature, doping, and thickness) and the target iron concentration, especially when compared to more flexible models like XGB or DNN.

%
%\textbf{Why increasing the number of features generally improves performance}:
%adding more physically meaningful descriptors-such as relative changes in $I_\mathrm{SC}$, $V_\mathrm{OC}$, $\eta$, and $FF$, along with structural parameters like temperature, doping, and base thickness-provides the model with more information about the underlying device physics.
%Each additional feature captures a different aspect of how iron-related recombination affects photovoltaic performance, helping the model to distinguish iron effects from other influences.
%This typically leads to improved prediction accuracy, as the model can learn more nuanced relationships.
%
%
%\textbf{Why adding features can sometimes degrade performance (especially with PCA or under AM1.5)}:
%adding more features does not always guarantee better results.
%In some cases-such as under AM1.5 illumination with PCA-adding additional descriptors can introduce redundancy or noise, especially if the new feature is highly correlated with existing ones or does not provide independent information about iron concentration.
%PCA, in particular, transforms the original features into linear combinations (principal components) that may not always preserve the most physically relevant information for the specific prediction task.
%This can occasionally lead to a decrease in model accuracy, as seen in our results.
%
%
%\textbf{Physical significance}: the physical meaning of these observations is that the most informative features for iron quantification are those most directly and sensitively affected by FeB dissociation (such as $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ and $\varepsilon \eta$).
%Including additional PV parameters or structural descriptors is beneficial up to the point where they add unique information.
%Beyond that, extra features may simply add noise or complexity, especially if the model or preprocessing (like PCA) cannot effectively filter out irrelevant components.

%
%\noindent
%\textcolor[rgb]{0.51,0.00,0.00}{\textbf{Reply:}}
%
%The improvement in prediction accuracy with certain combinations of features arises from both the physical relevance of the chosen descriptors and the ability of the models to leverage complementary information.
%
%
%Each photovoltaic parameter-such as the relative changes in $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$, $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$, $\varepsilon \eta$, and $\varepsilon FF$-reflects a different aspect of how iron-related recombination affects device performance after FeB pair dissociation. For example:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ is highly sensitive to changes in minority carrier lifetime, which is directly impacted by iron contamination;
%    \item $\varepsilon \eta$ and $\varepsilon FF$ capture broader effects on overall device performance, including losses due to recombination and resistive effects;
%    \item $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ is influenced by both recombination and the quality of the p-n junction.
%\end{itemize}
%
%Structural parameters such as temperature (T), base thickness ($d_p$), and boron doping ($N_\mathrm{B}$) further modulate how iron impacts the device, since the recombination dynamics and the extent of FeB dissociation depend on these factors.
%
%
%Combining multiple PV parameters and structural descriptors provides the model with a more complete picture of the device’s physical state. This allows the machine learning algorithm to distinguish between changes caused specifically by iron and those due to other factors (e.g., temperature or doping).
%
%
%Some features (like $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$) may show similar changes for different iron concentrations under certain conditions, but when combined with additional parameters (like $\varepsilon \eta$ or $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$), the model can resolve these ambiguities and make more accurate predictions.
%
%
%The impact of iron on PV parameters is not strictly linear, especially when considering interactions with temperature and doping.
%Including a carefully chosen set of features enables the model to capture these complex relationships.
%
%
%However, as discussed, adding features that are highly correlated or not physically informative can introduce noise or redundancy, sometimes reducing accuracy-especially after dimensionality reduction (PCA) or with less flexible models.

%Extrapolating to unseen parameter values can lead to unreliable or non-physical predictions, as the underlying device physics may change in ways not represented in the training data.

%For example, at much higher or lower doping levels, base thicknesses, or temperatures, the impact of iron on photovoltaic parameters may differ due to changes in recombination mechanisms, carrier mobilities, or defect formation, which are not captured by the current model.

%The proposed ML-based approach provides a non-destructive, rapid, and accurate method for quantifying iron concentration in boron-doped silicon solar cells using standard photovoltaic measurements.
%It`s main advantages include ease of implementation, suitability for inline process monitoring, and the ability to capture complex, physically meaningful dependencies.
%However, the method is currently limited to the parameter ranges and device types represented in the training data, and its applicability is primarily for boron-doped c-Si cells with known structural parameters.
%Future work will focus on expanding the model’s range and adapting the approach to other cell types and impurity systems.
