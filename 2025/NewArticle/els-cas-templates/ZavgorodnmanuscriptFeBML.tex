\begin{abstract}
This study presents a comprehensive investigation of the impact of iron defect variability on the efficiency of a silicon solar cell with an $n^+$--$p$--$p^+$ structure, along with a comparative analysis of popular machine learning methods aimed at estimating the concentration of contaminant iron in the solar cell. 
The modeling was performed in SCAPS--1D for a temperature range of $(290-340)$~K and iron concentrations from $10^{10}$ to $10^{14}$~cm$^{-3}$, considering material parameters' relevant temperature and concentration dependencies. 
Simulated and experimental data were obtained for the solar cell under standard AM1.5 illumination and monochromatic illumination at 940~nm. 
To predict Fe concentration, the following methods were used: Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). 
A total of 16 different sets of descriptors were considered, and the effect of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the accuracy of iron contamination prediction was analyzed. 
The models were evaluated on test sets, including descriptor values not encountered during model training.

\section{Introduction}%\label{}
\par
Pressing challenges associated with global warming and the depletion of fossil fuel reserves have spurred the exploration of renewable energy sources. 
Consequently, these factors have accelerated the development of photovoltaic (PV) technologies and significantly expanded the deployment of solar cells \cite{Pata2024, Holechek2022}. 
However, PV energy faces several significant challenges: the need to optimize solar cell manufacturing processes, improve the efficiency and stability of PV devices (either by discovering new materials or by enhancing existing structures), develop energy management systems designed to regulate the energy flow in real--time, and establish methods for monitoring the condition of PV converters, specifically through defect characterization. 
Simultaneously, applying machine learning (ML) methods, capable of detecting patterns and correlations that are not readily apparent from the perspective of traditional analysis \cite{Park2022}, opens new avenues for addressing the aforementioned challenges in PV. 
For instance, ML methods optimize individual production stages - such as crystal growth \cite{Qi2020} and plasma--enhanced vapor deposition \cite{Rachdi2021} - and streamline entire solar cell production lines that may involve up to ten processing steps and forty--seven process parameter inputs \cite{Buratti2020}. 
ML methods facilitate the enhancement of PV devices by identifying key PV materials, analyzing the mentions of the various structure names in the literature \cite{Zhang2022} or optimizing perovskite solar cells \cite{Liu2023}; 
designing renewable energy--based demand--side management systems \cite{Asghar2023}, obtaining additional information from internal quantum efficiency measurements \cite{AbdullahVetter2025}. There are significantly more references on ML applications in PV systems found in the reviews \cite{DiSabatino2024, Datta2023, Jaiswal2023, Buratti2024, Bhatti2023}.


This study focused on applying artificial intelligence to examine defects in greater detail. 
The majority of relevant research has focused on image--based analysis techniques, such as electroluminescence, photoluminescence, and infrared thermography, related to solar cells \cite{AlOtum2024, Pratt2021, Li2024a, Lin2021, Tang2020, Bu2022, Turek2023, Huang2022}. 
These methods facilitate detecting and classifying defects such as cracks, finger failures, hot spots, scratches, and horizontal dislocations and are predominantly implemented using convolutional neural networks. 
Another widely adopted approach involves applying ML models to current--voltage $I$-$V$ curves, enabling the identification of permanent and temporal faults in PV arrays \cite{Liu2021, Chen2019, Hopwood2020, Mellit2021}. 
A key advantage of this defect characterization method is its reliance on $I$-$V$ measurements, a standard procedure for PV device characterization. 
Additionally, ML techniques specifically targeting point defects warrant particular attention.
For instance, researchers have developed methods for determining the electronic structure of intrinsic defects \cite{Ma2025, Choudhary2023}, detecting radiation--induced defects via Raman spectroscopy \cite{Chia2024, Park2022}, and extracting recombination--active center parameters from temperature-- and injection--dependent lifetime measurements \cite{Wang2024a, Buratti2022, Buratti2020a}.
Although such defects constitute one of the main limitations of PV devices \cite{Le2024, Yamaguchi2018}, studies in this area remain scarce. 
Moreover, existing research predominantly focuses on characterizing defects in PV materials rather than solar cells and relies on data requiring specialized equipment.


This study proposes an ML--based approach to extract impurity concentrations from $I$-$V$ curves. 
Specifically, we focus on quantifying iron in boron--doped crystalline silicon solar cells. 
This constraint is not overly restrictive, given that 
(i) Si--based solar cells dominate the current PV market \cite{Bosnjakovic2024, Zhang2021}, with most manufactured from boron--doped crystalline silicon (c--Si:B); 
and (ii) iron is one of the most prevalent, omnipresent, and efficiency--limiting metallic impurities \cite{Buonassisi2006, IronSC}. 
It is well established that in p--type material, iron tends to bind with dopant atoms such as boron, forming iron–boron pairs under equilibrium conditions or existing as interstitial species only in the presence of sufficiently high free electron densities \cite{Kimerling1983, FeBAssJAP2014}. 
The deliberate switching between these states can be readily achieved through intense illumination, electron injection, or heating up to 200~$^\circ$C and is commonly employed in various methods for assessing iron concentration \cite{Zoth1990, Rein2, Schmidt2005, Goodarzi2017, Olikh2021JAP, FeMethod2012, Herguth2022, Macdonald2004}. 
The approach proposed in this study utilizes changes in PV (short--circuit current, open--circuit voltage, efficiency, and fill factor) resulting from FeB dissociation as input parameters for ML algorithms. 
The specified PV parameters can be readily extracted from $I$-$V$ characteristics, making this method advantageous compared to existing approaches:

\begin{itemize}
    \item unlike glow discharge mass spectrometry or secondary ion mass spectrometry \cite{DiSabatino2014}, it is non--destructive;
    \item it does not require specialized equipment or specially prepared samples, in contrast to Fourier--transform infrared spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, deep--level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), Laplace DLTS, carrier lifetime measurements, photoluminescence, or photoconductance \cite{Schroder2006, HowMuchPhysics, LaplDLTS, Rein2, Schmidt2005, FeMethod2012, Goodarzi2017};
    \item it is simpler and faster than other methods that rely on measuring the kinetics of short--circuit current \cite{Olikh2021JAP} and open--circuit voltage \cite{Herguth2022} but require lengthy experimental procedures or multiple illumination levels.
\end{itemize}


In our previous work \cite{Olikh2022PPV}, we employed a deep learning approach to estimate iron concentration based on the ideality factor, which was also derived from $I$-$V$ characteristics. 
However, the method proposed in this study imposes fewer constraints on the accuracy of $I$-$V$ measurements across the entire voltage range and the model used to describe actual structures' $I$-$V$ characteristics. 
Thus, our approach enables the simultaneous determination of iron impurity concentration alongside key electrical parameters. 
These 'inline' characterization techniques are essential for ensuring efficient production lines and optimizing processes to produce reliable solar cells. 
Notably, luminescence imaging is increasingly used for solar cell characterization. 
However, ML methods have been proposed to extract $I$-$V$ characteristic data from such images \cite{Kunze2023, Battaglia2023}. 
Integrating these methods with our approach into a unified pipeline would allow for extracting iron concentration data from luminescence measurements.

\subsection{Data Collection}
\par
Our research aimed to develop ML models for estimating iron concentration in silicon solar cells. 
Selecting relevant descriptors is a critical first step in developing robust and effective predictive models. 
It is well established that the presence of iron induces the formation of recombination centers, which, in turn, negatively affect the PV conversion process and key PV parameters, including short--circuit current ($I_\mathrm{SC}$), open--circuit voltage ($V_\mathrm{OC}$), efficiency ($\eta$), and fill factor ($F\!F$). 
Both theoretical and experimental studies \cite{FeB:Schmidt, IronSC, OUR WORK} have demonstrated that the restructuring of iron--related defects—specifically, the dissociation of FeB pairs—induces variations in PV parameters that depend on the iron concentration ($N_\mathrm{Fe}$). 
Consequently, in this study, we employ the relative changes in PV parameters caused by the restructuring process (Fe$_i$B$_\mathrm{Si}$ $\rightleftarrows$ Fe$_i$ + B$_\mathrm{Si}$) as descriptors of iron content. 
For instance, we define the relative change in short--circuit current ($\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$) as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq1}
    \varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC} = \frac{I_\mathrm{SC}^\mathrm{FeB} - I_\mathrm{SC}^\mathrm{Fe}}{I_\mathrm{SC}^\mathrm{FeB}} \times 100 \%\,,
\end{equation}
where $I_\mathrm{SC}^\mathrm{FeB}$ and $I_\mathrm{SC}^\mathrm{Fe}$ represent the short--circuit current values before and after pair dissociation, respectively. 
The relative changes in the other parameters ($\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$, $\varepsilon \eta$ and $\varepsilon F\!F$) were determined similarly. 
Using relative rather than absolute changes allowed, to some extent, the isolation of iron--related defect contributions from those of other recombination centers and helped mitigate potential fluctuations in external conditions, such as illumination intensity.


Previous studies \cite{FeB:Schmidt, OUR WORK} have shown that changes in PV parameters are influenced not only by iron concentration but also by the specific characteristics of the solar cell structure, such as doping level and base thickness, as well as external factors, including temperature and illumination spectrum. 
We must consider these effects when selecting the appropriate set of descriptors. 
Our study incorporated features such as boron concentration in the base ($N_\mathrm{B}$), base thickness ($d_p$), temperature ($T$) and developed separate models for different illumination conditions.


For this research, we obtained datasets from both simulations and experiments. 
Specifically, simulations of $I$-$V$ curves were conducted for a silicon $n^+$-$p$-$p^+$ structure using SCAPS~3.3.11. 
The SCAPS--1D software \cite{SCAPS1} is a widely used tool \cite{MasumMia2025, Joshi2024, Ravidas2024, Liu2024, You2023, SCAPSDefect3} that enables the modeling of barrier structure $I$-$V$ characteristics while accounting for defect states. 
PV parameters were determined from pairs of $I$-$V$ curves simulated for a solar cell with a known structure and a specified iron concentration under defined external conditions before and after FeB pair dissociation. 
It allowed us to obtain the values of $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$, $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$, $\varepsilon \eta$, and $\varepsilon F\!F$. 
A detailed description of the modeling approach, including the temperature dependencies of the silicon and defect states, is provided elsewhere \cite{Olikh2019SM, OUR WORK}.


To generate the training dataset, we conducted simulations over a temperature range of $(290-340)$~K for solar cells with a base thickness of$(180-380)$~$\mu$m, a boron concentration of $(10^{15} - 10^{17})$~cm$^{-3}$, and an iron concentration of $(10^{10} - 10^{14})$~cm$^{-3}$. 
The simulations covered all parameter combinations within a 4D grid, comprising 11 values along the $T$ axis, 5 along the $d_p$ axis, 9 along the $N_\mathrm{B}$ axis, and 25 along the $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ axis. 
The values were evenly distributed within the specified ranges, with $N_\mathrm{B}$ and $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ spaced logarithmically.


We also generated four test datasets through simulation, each representing different scenarios that may arise in the practical application of ML models. 
In one of these test datasets, the iron concentration values used in the simulation were not present in the training set. 
Meanwhile, the other parameters ($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$) matched the grid node values from the training set simulations. 
This dataset was labeled '\textit{$N_\mathrm{Fe}$--altered}'. 
Similarly, we created the '\textit{$N_\mathrm{B}$--altered}' and '\textit{$T$--altered}' test datasets using boron concentration and temperature values that were absent from the training dataset. 
In the '\textit{All-altered}' dataset, all four simulation parameters differed from those used in the training dataset.


The simulations for both the training and test datasets were conducted for two lighting scenarios: AM1.5 (corresponding to standard characterization conditions for PV devices) and monochromatic light with a wavelength of 940~nm and an intensity of 5~W/m$^{2}$ (reflecting the remarkable sensitivity of PVPs to iron \cite{OUR WORK}). 
For experimental validation of the proposed models, we used data obtained from measurements of real solar cells. 
Iron concentration, determined using the methodology described in \cite{Olikh2022:JMatSci, Olikh2021JAP}, showed that $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ ranged from $2\times10^{11}$ to $4\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$ in different samples.
We used a set of $n^+$-$p$-$p^+$--Si samples in the experiment. 
The structure was fabricated from a 380~$\mu$m thick $p$--type boron--doped Czochralski silicon (100) wafer with a doping level of $N_\mathrm{B}=1.36\times10^{15}$~cm$^{-3}$. 
To create the experimental test dataset, we measured the $I$-$V$ characteristics under monochromatic illumination from a light--emitting diode (SN–HPIR940nm–1W) with a wavelength of 940~nm and an intensity of approximately 5~W/m$^{2}$ within a temperature range of $(305-340)$~K. 
The decay of FeB pairs was induced using intensive halogen lamp illumination (7000~W/m$^{2}$).

\subsection{Data Pre--Processing}
\par
Feature selection emerges as a pivotal pre--processing step in developing a forecasting model. 
Selecting the appropriate number of features requires balancing two competing factors. 
On the one hand, fewer features simplify data collection and reduce computational costs. 
On the other hand, incorporating more features may enhance prediction accuracy by providing additional information. 
In this study, various feature combinations were explored. 
As shown in \cite{OUR WORK}, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ is a key metric for quantifying iron impurities due to its monotonic dependence on iron concentration and relatively large absolute values during the Fe$_i$B$_\mathrm{Si}$ $\rightleftarrows$ Fe$_i$ + B$_\mathrm{Si}$ transformation. 
The following most suitable parameters for estimating $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ are $\varepsilon \eta$, $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$, and $\varepsilon F\!F$ \cite{OUR WORK}. 


Moreover, $N_\mathrm{B}$ (one of the selected descriptors) and $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ (target output) span several orders of magnitude. 
To achieve high prediction accuracy, we transformed the doping level and iron concentration to log $N_\mathrm{B}$ and log $N_\mathrm{Fe}$. 
This approach is standard for quantities that vary across a wide range \cite{Srivastava2023, Minagawa2024}.


Thus, we used the following sets to predict $y = \log N_\mathrm{Fe}$:
($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$);
($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$, $\varepsilon \eta$);
($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$, $\varepsilon \eta$, $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$);
($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$, $\varepsilon \eta$, $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$, $\varepsilon F\!F$). For simplicity, we will refer to the number of features as "dimension" from here on. 
In different models, we used features with dimensions of 4, 5, 6, and 7.


Data normalization transforms a dataset's values into a standard scale, which can increase the model's accuracy. 
To standardize our features, we normalized them to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.


Increasing the number of features is not always beneficial in informativeness if the descriptors are not independent. 
This study used the Pearson correlation coefficient to assess the correlation between the input features. 
We found that changes in PV parameters are not entirely independent, especially under monochromatic illumination – see Fig.~S1  in Supplementary Material. 
Unsurprisingly, each PV parameter is related to the diffusion and recombination of photo--induced carriers. $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$, $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$, $\varepsilon \eta$, and $\varepsilon F\!F$ exhibit a sufficiently high correlation with the boron concentration. 
$N_\mathrm{B}$ determines the position of the Fermi level, which, in turn, significantly affects the intensity of recombination processes within the Shockley--Read--Hall approximation. 
It creates the physical prerequisites for the observed correlation.


To ensure that ML algorithms are trained on independent input features while reducing data redundancy and memory usage, we employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
PCA constructs new, uncorrelated features (principal components, PCs) and allows us to evaluate each PC's contribution to the total information variance. 
Fig.~\ref{fig2} demonstrates that increasing the feature dimension does not always enhance overall information variance. 
To assess the impact of redundant data, we trained ML models using features obtained as follows: we built PCs for the original dataset and then reduced the total dimension by discarding those PCs whose contribution to the total variance did not exceed 1.5\%. 
The final dimensions of the different feature sets are provided in Table~\ref{tbl1}.

\begin{figure}

     \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{Fig2a.png}

	  \caption{Cumulative explained variance versus number of PC components. Features dimension: 4 (a), 5 (b), 6 (c), 7 (d).

\end{tabular*}
\end{table}


This approach preserves most of the information while simultaneously reducing dimensionality and simplifying the model. 
Researchers frequently implement this approach in ML--based defect characterization \cite{Ma2025, Chia2024}.

\subsection{Machine Learning Algorithms}
\par
We used five ML algorithms to construct regression models to predict iron concentration.


\textit{Random Forest} (RF) enhances predictive accuracy by training multiple decision trees on different subsets of the dataset. 
RF combines predictions from all trees using majority voting, preventing overfitting and increasing robustness to noise \cite{Breiman2001}.


\textit{Gradient Boosting} (GB) combines multiple weak learners, such as decision trees. 
It sequentially adds predictors to the model, with each correcting its predecessor, strengthening the overall prediction.
The model produces the final prediction by aggregating forecasts, typically through a weighted sum \cite{Natekin2013}.


\textit{eXtreme Gradient Boosting} (XGB) is an advanced ensemble method for gradient--boosting machines \cite{Akinpelu2024}. 
Unlike GB, XGB employs the Newton--Raphson method with second--order derivatives of the loss function, enhancing accuracy, speed, and efficiency for large datasets.


\textit{Support Vector Regression} (SVR) is based on locating a hyperplane with the most significant margin of separation between data points of various classes. 
SVR maps input data into a high--dimensional feature space using kernel functions, effectively capturing nonlinear relationships \cite{Cao2020}.


\textit{Deep Neural Network} (DNN) consists of numerous interconnected neurons that process input data through multiple nonlinear transformations \cite{Liu2023}.


All the applied algorithms have demonstrated effectiveness in previous defect studies \cite{Buratti2020a, Buratti2022, Olikh2022PPV, Buratti2024}. 
The models are implemented using Python toolkits: Keras for DNN, Scikit--learn for RF, GB, SVR, and XGBoost for XGB. 
Hyperparameter tuning is crucial for optimizing model performance \cite{Hanif2024}. 
We used the Optuna toolkit to optimize model parameters, employing the TPE sampler and Hyperband pruner for efficient hyperparameter selection. 
Tables~S1–S5 (Supplementary Material) list the tuned hyperparameters and their search ranges, while Tables~S6–S10 present the selected optimal combinations.


We tested 80 models, varying the ML algorithm, illumination conditions, feature set dimensions, and PCA application. 
Hereafter, models are denoted as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq2}
    MLM^\mathrm{Illum}_\mathrm{Feat},
\end{equation}
where $MLM$ is the applied algorithm: RF, GB, XGB, SVR, or DNN; $Illum$ indicates the solar cell illumination type: illum $\in$ {AM1.5, 940}; $Feat$ represents the feature dimension and PCA application: $Feat \in$ {4, 5, 6, 7, 4:PC, 5:PC, 6:PC, 7:PC}.

\subsection{Model evaluation}
\par
To build a regression model, measuring its performance using various evaluation metrics is crucial. 
These metrics help assess how well the model has learned and predicted the outcomes. 
We evaluated iron quantification using the mean square error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination (R2), defined in Eqs.~(\ref{eq3})-(\ref{eq5}):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq3}
    MSE = \frac{1}{N}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\hat{y_i}-y_i)^2,
\end{equation}


where $\hat{y_i}$ represents the predicted value for the $i$-th data point, $y_i$ is the known value for the $i$-th data point, and $N$ is the number of samples in the dataset. 
MSE is one of the most commonly used metrics for evaluating model accuracy. 
However, since the computation of $\hat{y_i}$ involves the normalization and logarithmization of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$, this metric does not fully reflect the accuracy of iron contamination estimation. 
Therefore, we used MAPE, which determines the mean relative error:
\begin{equation}

    MAPE = \frac{1}{N}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{|N_\mathrm{Fe,pred}-N_\mathrm{Fe,true}|}{N_\mathrm{Fe,true}}\times 100 \%\,
\end{equation}


where $N_\mathrm{Fe,pred}$ is the predicted value of iron concentration, $N_\mathrm{Fe,true}$ is the known value (used in simulation or obtained from experimental iron determination). 
The $R^2$ score is often interpreted as the percentage of explained variance and measures how well the predicted and true values are aligned; a value of unity indicates a perfect prediction:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq5}
    R^2 = 1-\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i-\hat{y_i})^2}{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i-\bar{y})^2},
\end{equation}


where $\bar{y}$ is the average of the true values.

%The necessity for renewable energy sources to meet the growing global demand for sustainable and environmentally friendly energy alternatives has become evident.
%Among the wide range of renewable energy sources, sunlight is the cleanest, safest,
%and most abundant source for use in sustainable energy to support economic growth \cite{PratapSingh2019}.
%The utilization of solar energy heavily depends on the use of photovoltaic cells, with silicon--based devices playing a critical role \cite{Basnet2024,Wang2024}.
%
%

%The issue of semiconductor purity has become increasingly significant since the advent of the transistor in 1947 \cite{Claers2018}.
%The 1960 study by Shockley and Queisser \cite{Goetzberger1960} demonstrated that
%the electrical properties of $n^{+}-p$ silicon diodes deteriorate when impurity atoms of metals such as Cu, Fe, Mn, Au, Zn, and Ni are present.
%This study prompted investigations focused on preventing contaminating metals from entering semiconductors during manufacturing.
%In particular, metallic impurities are known to reduce the efficiency of
%silicon--based devices through direct shunting \cite{Rsh:Breitenstein},
%increased leakage current \cite{Lee1980},
%or bulk recombination \cite{Istratov2000}.
%Despite extensive study of metallic impurities in silicon over the past fifty years \cite{Claers2018,Pearce1977},
%the problem continues to attract significant attention \cite{Hajjiah2020,Le2024,Maoudj2021,OlikhPSSA,LaineIEEEPV2016}.
%
%
%Iron is prominent among metallic contaminants, with its atoms being among
%the most prevalent and detrimental impurities in silicon solar cells (SSCs) \cite{Buonassisi2006}.
%Even in small concentrations (about $10^{10}$~cm$^{-3}$),
%point defects related to Fe can significantly influence the performance of SSCs \cite{IronSC,Herguth2022}.
%Therefore, it is of critical importance to assess the concentration of iron impurities.
%In response to this challenge, various methodologies have been put forward,
%often based on the property of iron atoms to form pairs with acceptors.
%In particular, iron atoms are predominantly located in interstitial positions in silicon, forming the Fe$_i$ defect.
%In $p$--type crystals, without external illumination, iron atoms carry positive charges and tend to bond with negatively charged doping atoms
%(boron, aluminum, gallium, or indium), forming Fe$_i$B$_\mathrm{Si}$ pairs \cite{Kimerling1983}.
%However, these pairs can destabilized by intense illumination, electron injection, or heating up to 200~$^\circ$C \cite{FeBAssJAP2014}.
%The recombination properties of iron-related defects Fe$_i$ and Fe$_i$B$_s$ differ significantly,
%which profoundly affects the overall characteristics of the crystal.
%This fact formed the basis for the first method of assessing iron concentration \cite{Zoth1990},
%which relied on measuring the diffusion length of minority carriers using the surface photovoltage method \cite{Tousek2008}.
%Many other methods involve measurements of carrier lifetime \cite{Rein2,Schmidt2005},
%Quasi-Steady-State Photoconductance \cite{Goodarzi2017},
%or the study of kinetic dependencies of short-circuit current \cite{Olikh2021JAP}
%or photoluminescence intensity \cite{FeMethod2012} during the reaction Fe$_i$B$_\mathrm{Si}$ $\rightleftarrows$ Fe$_i$ + B$_\mathrm{Si}$.
%
%
%Notably, the presence of Fe--related defects affects the dynamics of electron and hole movement within the solar cell,
%which is reflected in changes to the appearance of the current--voltage ($I$-$V$) characteristics of SSCs overall,
%as well as modifications to the main photoelectric parameters
%(short-circuit current  $I_\mathrm{SC}$,
%open-circuit voltage $V_\mathrm{OC}$,
%efficiency $\eta$, and fill factor $F\!F$)
%in particular.
%These findings create fundamental possibilities to advance methods for estimating iron concentration by $I$-$V$ curves measuring before and after pair dissolution.
%The advantages of such an approach are associated with the possibility of directly characterizing finished solar cells,
%as well as the absence of the need for additional equipment other than that required for $I$-$V$ measurements, which is extremely common.
%Efforts have been made initially in developing such methods.
%For instance, it was proposed to estimate the concentration of iron in SSCs based on changes in the ideality factor \cite{Olikh2019SM,Olikh2022PPV}
%or open-circuit voltage \cite{Herguth2022}.
%However, developing such approaches requires evaluating how a particular parameter changes when iron--containing pairs dissolve
%and determining whether it can estimate the iron concentration $N_\mathrm{Fe}$.
%For example, the most evident conditions for utilizing a specific parameter include its change due to the transformation
%Fe$_i$B$_\mathrm{Si}$ $\rightarrow$ Fe$_i$ +B$_\mathrm{Si}$,
%at least by 10~\%, along with a monotonic dependence of these changes on $N_\mathrm{Fe}$.
%
%
%This paper intends to determine the variations of $I_\mathrm{SC}$, $V_\mathrm{OC}$, $\eta$, and $F\!F$
%resulting from the decay of iron-containing pairs in boron-doped silicon solar cells.
%Previous similar calculations have been conducted \cite{FeB:Schmidt,IronSC,Hajjiah2020},
%but the results presented typically pertain only to certain temperatures,
%illumination levels (often AM1.5), and solar cells with specific parameters.
%In this study, we performed calculations over a sufficiently wide temperature range (290-340~K)
%and for solar cells with varying base thickness (180-380~$\mu$m) and doping levels
%(boron concentration in the base ranging from $10^{15}$ to $10^{17}$~cm$^{-3}$).
%The results obtained allow us to assess the feasibility and potential of using the
%main photovoltaic parameters of specific solar cells to estimate the $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ value across a range of temperatures,
%including conditions similar to those encountered in typical SSC applications.
%Furthermore, investigations have explored changes in photoelectric performance under not only solar illumination (AM1.5G)
%but also low-intensity monochromatic light (wavelength of 940~nm, intensities of 5~W/m$^{2}$ and 10~W/m$^{2}$).
%In the first case, while it is customary to adhere to standard conditions,
%it's essential to consider that illumination at 1000~W/m$^{2}$ can lead to the decay of Fe$_i$B$_s$ complexes \cite{Macdonald2004}.
%Therefore, measurements for cases requiring the presence of undissociated pairs in silicon must meet specific constraints.
%On the other hand, intentionally chosen monochromatic illumination penetrates the emitter with negligible losses and does not reach the rear side.
%In this context, the photoelectric parameters show remarkable sensitivity
%to recombination processes occurring within the solar cell base and to iron concentration in this region.
%Finally, in our calculations, we attempted to use the latest literature data
%concerning the exact values of silicon parameters, including light absorption values \cite{Green2022}
%and coefficients characterizing intrinsic recombination \cite{Brad2022,AugerSi2022}.

Fig.~\ref{fig3} displays the models’ prediction results on the training set.
Supplementary Materials (Figs.~S4--S7) contain more detailed results, while Table~S12 and Table~S13 list the performance metrics. 
RF and GB models provide the most accurate predictions, whereas SVR demonstrates the poorest performance. 
Applying PCA tends to reduce prediction accuracy in the training set.


As expected, increasing the number of descriptors improves model performance (Fig.~\ref{fig4} and S7). 
The only exception occurs under AM1.5 illumination with PCA, where adding a fifth descriptor can worsen predictions instead of improving them. 
Overall, models trained on AM1.5 data exhibit significantly lower accuracy than those using monochromatic illumination, with errors roughly an order of magnitude higher. 
In particular, models with four descriptors (and five with PCA) under AM1.5 seem unpromising, even for RF and GB. 
Meanwhile, increasing the number of descriptors from six to seven provides little to no additional benefit in high--accuracy models such as RF, GB, XGB, and, to some extent, DNN.

Fig.~\ref{fig5} presents typical dependencies of the proportion of predictions with a given accuracy on ($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, and $N_\mathrm{Fe}$), which allows assessing the predictive capabilities of the models depending on measurement conditions, solar cell structure, and iron concentration. 
The presented data indicate that the most challenging cases for prediction are those with $N_\mathrm{Fe}<10^{11}$~cm$^{-3}$, as well as solar cells with a base doping level around $10^{16}$~cm$^{-3}$. 
It occurs because, as shown by calculations \cite{OLIKH2025MSEB}, variations in PV parameters during FeB pair dissociation remain minimal. 
Meanwhile, measurement temperature and base thickness (when feature dimensionality exceeds 4) have virtually no impact on prediction accuracy.

\subsection{$N_\mathrm{Fe}$--altered test dataset}
\par
The $N_\mathrm{Fe}$--altered test dataset resembles a practical scenario, where the goal is to predict iron concentration based on PVP variations measured under standardized conditions for predefined structures (with temperature and solar cell parameters used during model training).


Fig.~\ref{fig6} and Figures~S8–S11 present the prediction results, while Fig.~\ref{fig7} and Table~\ref{table2} summarize the performance metrics. 
SVR consistently performs poorly, a trend observed in all test datasets. 
Since this pattern remains unchanged in subsequent analyses, we do not discuss it further. 
For the remaining models, it is essential to distinguish between results obtained under monochromatic and solar illumination. 
Under 940~nm illumination without PCA, almost all algorithms achieve reasonably accurate predictions, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of approximately 10\%.
DNN models produced slightly worse results, while XGB exhibited marginally better performance. 
Interestingly, increasing the feature dimensionality does not enhance prediction accuracy but reduces it. 
In particular, incorporating the relative changes in the fill factor into the descriptor set significantly degrades DNN predictions.
As shown in Table~\ref{table2}, RF, GB, and XGB (the most accurate models) demonstrate a noticeable decline in MdAPE and a rise in p01 and p10 as the number of descriptors increases. 
These trends indicate that expanding feature dimensionality results in a greater share of predictions with significant errors, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig8}a for GB. 
Fig.~\ref{fig8}a and Table~\ref{table2} show that PCA--based model simplification increases the proportion of high--error predictions in XGB while reducing it in RF and GB. 
In summary, $\mathrm{GB}^\mathrm{940}_\mathrm{4:PC}$, $\mathrm{GB}^\mathrm{940}_\mathrm{5:PC}$, and $\mathrm{XGB}^\mathrm{940}_\mathrm{5}$ yield the most precise results for this test dataset under monochromatic illumination, with the proportion of predictions reaching at least 10\% accuracy at 80.3\%, 82.4\%, and 78.6\%, respectively.
When estimating the iron concentration based on changes in PVP values obtained under AM1.5 illumination, using only four descriptors does not provide sufficiently accurate predictions with any model. 
Adding efficiency variations (increasing the feature dimension from 4 to 5) enables DNN and XGB to predict $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ with MAPE slightly above 10\%, though the results remain inferior to those under monochromatic illumination.
The use of PCA significantly worsens the results (see Fig.~\ref{fig7}f, Fig.~\ref{fig7}n, Table~\ref{table2}). 
A further increase in the feature dimension improves prediction accuracy and reduces the difference between models with and without PCA. 
The best results are observed when using 7 descriptors. 
For RF and GB, applying PCA reduces both the mean errors (Fig.~\ref{fig7}p) and the proportion of predictions with large deviations from the true values (Table~\ref{table2}).
For XGB and DNN, which exhibit the highest efficiency across the entire $N_\mathrm{Fe}$--altered test dataset, including data under 940~nm illumination, PCA does not provide any benefit (Fig.~\ref{fig7}p, Fig.~\ref{fig8}b). 
Notably, in these cases, the proportion of predictions with accuracy below 10\% does not exceed 1.3\%.
The results highlight the importance of selecting an optimal model and applying appropriate data preprocessing for accurate iron concentration prediction in silicon solar cells.

\subsection{$T$--altered test dataset}
\par
The $T$--altered test dataset simulates a scenario where impurity concentration estimates rely on measurements taken under conditions different from those used for model training. 
This dataset also includes temperature values (287~K, 341~K, and 342~K) that extend beyond the training range $(290-340)$~K, allowing an assessment of the models' extrapolation capability.


Figures~S12–S15 present the prediction results, while Fig.~\ref{fig9} and Table~\ref{table3} summarize the performance metrics. 
The data indicate that the average metrics for all models slightly worsen compared to the $N_\mathrm{Fe}$--altered dataset (Fig.~\ref{fig7}, Fig.~\ref{fig9}). 
In most cases, PCA reduces model performance, except for AM1.5 at a feature dimension of 7. 
For the 940~nm case, using 6 descriptors proves more effective than using 4, as observed in the previous test dataset.


A comparison of Table~\ref{table2} and Table~\ref{table3} shows that, unlike the mean characteristics, MdAPE, p01, and p10 are often even better than in the $N_\mathrm{Fe}$--altered dataset. 
For example, for $\mathrm{XGB}^\mathrm{940}_\mathrm{6}$, MdAPE and p01 reach 2.47\% and 33.6\%, whereas in the previous case, the best values were 4.46\% and 13.6\%. 
These differences in the behavior of MSE, MAPE, and R² compared to other performance metrics indicate a higher proportion of accurate predictions while increasing errors in less successful forecasts. 
In other words, prediction disparity increases--more accurate predictions become even more precise, while less accurate ones deviate further.


Fig.~\ref{fig10} illustrates the dependence of the proportion of predictions with an error below 10\% on temperature for the two training datasets. 
Within the $(290–340)$~K range, where the networks were trained, both datasets exhibit similar p10 values and overall trends despite the temperature values in the $T$--altered test dataset differing from those used during training. 
Specifically, p10 remains nearly independent of temperature, consistent with the trend observed in Fig.~\ref{fig5}d. 
However, a slight deviation of a few kelvins from the training range significantly reduces prediction accuracy. 
This behavior highlights the models' limited extrapolation capability compared to their interpolation performance. 
The degradation of the averaged metrics (MSE, MAPE, R$^{2}$) mainly results from lower prediction accuracy at temperatures beyond the training range. 


Thus, applying the models to measurement data obtained at temperatures that deviate slightly from the training conditions but remain within the training range is justified.

	  \caption{MSE (a--h), MAPE (i--p), and R$^{2}$ (q, r) scores for various models, feature combinations, and illumination conditions on the $T$--altered test dataset. Illumination: 940~nm (a--d, i--l, q), AM1.5 (e--h, m--p, r). Feature dimensions: 4 (a, e, i, m), 5 (b, f, j, n), 6 (c, g, k, o), and 7 (d, h, l, p). Results with PCA are shown as circles (a--h) and shaded areas (i--r), while results without PCA are represented by squares (f--h) and filled regions (i--r). The numbers in panels (a--h) represent MSE values multiplied by 1000, while the numbers in panels (i--p) indicate MAPE values in percentage.

%The study involved simulation $I$-$V$ curves of SSCs with an $n^+-p-p^+$ structure,

%The structures with a base uniformly doped with boron were under consideration.
%The doping concentration $N_\mathrm{B}$, and the base thickness $d_p$ were varied during the modeling process, as detailed in Table~\ref{table1}.
%The emitter and $p^+$-layer were considered to be unevenly doped.
%The concentration profiles of the dopants, their maximum values ($N_{p^+,\mathrm{max}}$ and $N_{n^+,\mathrm{max}}$),

%
%The simulation was conducted using the SCAPS~3.3.11 code \cite{SCAPS1}.
%SCAPS-1D software, developed by the University of Gent, is founded on theoretical computations that involve solving Poisson's equation,
%continuity equations for holes and electrons, and drift-diffusion at each position within the solar cell,
%considering the boundary conditions.
%Despite its one-dimensional modeling approach, SCAPS is extensively used for modeling various types of solar cells \cite{Joshi2024,Ravidas2024,Liu2024,You2023} in general
%and for investigating the effects of defects on their performance \cite{AitAbdelkadir2023,Liang2024,SCAPSDefect3} in particular.
%
%
%As can be seen from Table~\ref{table1}, calculations spanned a broad range of temperatures and base doping levels.
%Therefore, to improve the accuracy of the calculations when inputting the initial parameters into SCAPS,
%temperature and concentration (where applicable) dependencies of the following silicon parameters were taken into account:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item bandgap according to Passler \cite{Passler2002};
%    \item doping induced bandgap narrowing according to Yan \& Cuevas \cite{EgNarrow};
%    \item effective density of states at conduction and valence band and intrinsic carrier concentration according to Couderc et al. \cite{Si_ni_Couderc};
%    \item thermal carrier velocities according to Green \cite{Nc:Green};
%    \item free carrier effective masses according to O’Mara et al. \cite{OMara};
%    \item carrier mobilities according to Klaassen's theory \cite{KLAASSEN953};
%\end{itemize}
%
%The values of surface recombination coefficients were considered equal to the thermal velocities of carriers \cite{Fell2015}.
%The calculations addressed recombination processes within the structural volume,
%incorporating both intrinsic recombination and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination at iron-related defects.
%In the first case, processes of band-to-band radiation recombination were considered
%(where the calculation of the corresponding coefficient included the fraction of radiatively emitted photons
%reabsorbed via band-to-band processes according to Niewelt et al.\cite{Brad2022})
%and Auger recombination (where the coefficients considered the effect of Coulomb enhancement \cite{AugerSi2022} and temperature dependence \cite{Si_Auger}).
%
%
%When accounting for the influence of iron impurities,
%we considered that Fe atoms were uniformly distributed within the base and $p^+$-layer
%with a total concentration of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ (see Table~\ref{table1}).
%Two cases were under consideration:
%
%Case~1.
%The concentration of interstitial iron defects $\left[\mathrm{Fe}_i\right]=N_\mathrm{Fe}$  at each position throughout the solar cell,
%with no pairs present $\left[\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s\right]=0$.
%This case corresponds to the state of the structure immediately after intense illumination, for example.
%
%Case~2.
%Iron atoms predominantly form pairs with acceptors, $\left[\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s\right] \gg \left[\mathrm{Fe}_i\right]$,
%but the exact concentration ratio depends on the position of the Fermi level and temperature \cite{FeB:kinetic,MurphyJAP2011}
%and varies from point to point within the solar cell.
%Further details about calculation of the concentration profiles of Fe$_i$B$_s$ and Fe$_i$ are provided in \cite{Olikh2022PPV,Olikh2019SM}.
%This case corresponds to prolonged storage of the structure in darkness or under conditions of low-intensity ($< 0.01$~J~cm$^{-2}$ \cite{Macdonald2004}) illumination.
%
%
%During the calculations, it was assumed that Fe$_i$ forms a single donor level,
%while the Fe$_i$B$_s$ pair has a trigonal configuration and acts as an amphoteric defect.
%We obtained defect parameters (including level positions within the bandgap and electron and hole capture cross-sections) from relevant studies \cite{ROUGIEUX2018,Istratov1999,Paudyal}.
%
%As previously mentioned, the solar cell behavior was simulated under different illumination conditions,
%including solar light (AM1.5G) and monochromatic light (wavelength 940~nm, intensity of $W_\mathrm{ill} = 5$~W/m$^{2}$ or 10~W/m$^{2}$) --- see Table~\ref{table1}.
%The calculations incorporated the light absorption values in silicon based on Green's study \cite{Green2022}.
%
%
%The $I$-$V$ characteristics were simulated for both Case~1 and Case~2 (see Fig.~\ref{fig2}),
%and from each curve, the short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, efficiency, and fill factor were determined.
%Assessing the influence of iron defect variability relied on the relative changes in each photovoltaic conversion parameter:

%    \varepsilon A = \frac{A^\mathrm{FeB} - A^\mathrm{Fe}}{A^\mathrm{FeB}} \times 100 \%\,,
%\end{equation}
%where $A$ represents one of the parameters ($I_\mathrm{SC}$, $V_\mathrm{OC}$, $\eta$, and $F\!F$),
%superscript ‘‘FeB’’ corresponds to the parameter value for coexistence of Fe$_i$ and Fe$_i$B$_s$ (Case~2),
%superscript ‘‘Fe’’ is related to the decay of all pairs (Case~1).
%
%
%Impact of change of iron defects was investigated as a function of temperature from 290~K to 340~K,
%base depth from 180~$\mu$m to 380~$\mu$m,
%base doping level from $10^{15}$~cm$^{-3}$ to $10^{17}$~cm$^{-3}$,
%and total impurity iron atom concentration from $10^{10}$~cm$^{-3}$ to $10^{14}$~cm$^{-3}$.
%For each illumination scenario, calculations were carried out with 11 different temperature values and 5 base depth values,
%evenly distributed within the specified ranges.
%The concentration values were distributed equally on a logarithmic scale with 4 ($N_\mathrm{B}$ case) and 6 ($N_\mathrm{Fe}$ case) steps per decade.
%As a result, for the AM1.5 illumination scenario, for instance, 24750 $I$-$V$ characteristics were simulated.
%An exception occurred with monochromatic illumination at $W_\mathrm{ill} = 10$~W/m$^{2}$,
%where we used only two $d_p$ values.
%
%\subsection{Experimental Details}
%
%To evaluate the validity of the simulated results,
%we also conducted experimental studies on the effect of changing the state of iron-related defects on the photoelectric parameters of silicon solar cells.
%
%The $n^+$-$p$-$p^+$-Si samples were used in the experiment.
%The structure was fabricated from a 380~$\mu$m thick $p$-type boron-doped
%Czochralski silicon (100) wafer with doping level $N_\mathrm{B}=1.36\times10^{15}$~cm$^{-3}$.
%The $n^+$ emitter with a sheet resistance of about $20-30$~$\Omega/\Box$
%and  thickness of $0.7$~$\mu$m was formed by phosphorus diffusion.
%The anti-recombination isotype barrier was created by using a $p^+$
%layer ($10-20$~$\Omega/\Box$) formed by boron diffusion.
%On the front surface, SiO$_2$ (40~nm) and Si$_3$N$_4$ (30~nm) films were formed as antireflective and passivating layers, respectively.
%The solid and grid Al contacts were formed by magnetron sputtering on the back and front surfaces, respectively.
%
%The $I$-$V$ characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2450 source meter and
%low--intensity monochromatic light source (light--emitting diode SN--HPIR940nm--1W with light wavelength 940~nm and intensity of about  $W_\mathrm{ill} = 5$~W/m$^{2}$).
%
%For different samples, the iron concentration ranged from $2\times10^{11}$ to $4\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$.
%The values of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ were determined using a methodology \cite{Olikh2022:JMatSci,Olikh2021JAP}, based on fitting the kinetics of short-circuit current.
%The decay of Fe$_i$B$_s$ pairs was realized using intensive (7000~W/$\mathrm{m}^{2}$) halogen lamp illumination.
%
%The measurements were carried over the temperature range of 300-340~K.
%The sample temperature was driven by a thermoelectric cooler controlled by an STS-21 sensor
%and maintained constant by a PID algorithm embedded in the software that serves the experimental setup.


\section{Results and Discussion}%\label{}

%\subsection{Short--circuit current}
%
%Figure~\ref{fig3} illustrates the characteristic dependencies of short-circuit current variations resulting
%from the reconfiguration of iron-containing defects, as obtained from the simulations.
%We present a more comprehensive set of figures that depict the detailed dependencies of $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ on
%all parameters varied during the calculations in the Supplementary Material (Figs.~S1-S6).
%It is important to note that the qualitative nature of the short-circuit current variations remains practically identical
%under both solar and monochromatic illumination, with the quantitative parameters of $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ differing:
%at 940~nm, the absolute values of $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ are approximately 3--4 times greater than those observed under AM1.5 conditions,
%assuming other parameters are constant.
%Among other features of $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ changes, we can highlight the following:
%

%}\label{fig3}
%\end{figure}
%
%\noindent
%- The module $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ increases monotonically with increasing iron concentration,
%    but the sign of this value depends on the doping level.
%    At low boron concentrations ($N_\mathrm{B}=10^{15}$~cm$^{-3}$) $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC} > 0$,
%    whereas at high concentrations ($N_\mathrm{B}=10^{17}$~cm$^{-3}$) $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC} < 0$ --- see Figs.~\ref{fig3}a,~\ref{fig3}c, S3--S6;
%
%\noindent
%- Increasing the acceptor concentration causes a monotonic decrease in $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ (Figs.~\ref{fig3}b,~\ref{fig3}d);
%    the $N_\mathrm{B}$ value at which the sign of $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ changes depends on the temperature
%    (decreases with decreasing in $T$ value) and the type of illumination (is generally higher in the case of monochromatic light) --- see Fig.~S2;
%
%\noindent
% - In the case where $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC} < 0$, an temperature increase causes a decrease in the absolute magnitude
%    of the relative changes in short--circuit current, with the dependence being nearly linear and
%    the slope increasing with higher doping levels and iron concentration (Figs.~\ref{fig3}a,~\ref{fig3}c, S4).
%    In the case where $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC} > 0$,
%    a $T$ changing results in minor non-monotonic variations of the short-circuit current after the dissociation of Fe$_i$B$_s$  pairs (Fig.~S3);
%
%\noindent
%- The influence of base thickness on $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ increases with
%    increasing $N_\mathrm{B}$ and decreasing $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ (Figs.~S5, S3), but it is minimal overall.
%    As calculations have shown, increasing $d_p$ by more than twice causes changes in $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ that do not exceed 0.5~\%;
%
%\noindent
%- Changing the intensity of the monochromatic illumination (from 5~W/m$^{2}$ to 10~W/m$^{2}$) does not practically change the value of $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$;
%
%
%\noindent
%- The absolute values of $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ can reach relatively high values (more than 100~\% for 940~nm illumination);
%    however, in cases where $N_\mathrm{Fe}<10^{11}$~cm$^{-3}$ and around $N_\mathrm{B}=10^{16}$~cm$^{-3}$, the changes in short-circuit current do not exceed a few percent.
%
%
%
%The identified features of the $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ changes can be explained by considering
%the main reasons for the influence of factors, which varied during simulation, on the photovoltaic conversion.
%It is known \cite{YangHandbookPVSi} that the main influence of metal impurities on solar cell performance is caused
%by their effect on the collection efficiency (CE, portion of excess carriers that reach the depletion region of $p$–$n$ junction).
%Neglecting the influence of series and shunt resistances, the short-circuit current coincides with the photocurrent $I_\mathrm{ph}$,
%which equals the CE multiplied by the number of light-induced excess carriers.
%In turn, the CE can be calculated as a convolution of generation function, which is proportional to $\exp(-\alpha z)$
%(where $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient and $z$ is the coordinate along the axis directed
%perpendicular to the $p$-$n$ junction from the emitter)
%and the collection probability, which can be obtained as a solution of homogeneous diffusion equation.
%
%The photogenerated current for the cell can be obtained by adding the relevant quantities
%for the base $I_\mathrm{ph,b}$ and the emitter $I_\mathrm{ph,e}$ \cite{Markvart}:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq2}
%     I_\mathrm{SC} \approx I_\mathrm{ph} = I_\mathrm{ph,e} + I_\mathrm{ph,b}\,.
%\end{equation}
%
%
%However, considering the location of the impurity iron,
%it can be assumed that during the Fe$_i$B$_\mathrm{Si}$ $\rightleftharpoons$ Fe$_i$ + B$_\mathrm{Si}$ reconfiguration,
%the first term on the right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{eq2})
%remains unchanged ($I_\mathrm{ph,e}^\mathrm{FeB}$ = $I_\mathrm{ph,e}^\mathrm{Fe}$ = $I_\mathrm{ph,e}$),
%and therefore, considering Eq.~(\ref{eq1}):
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq3}
%     \varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC} = \frac{I_\mathrm{ph,b}^\mathrm{FeB}-I_\mathrm{ph,b}^\mathrm{Fe}}{I_\mathrm{ph,e}+I_\mathrm{ph,b}^\mathrm{FeB}}\times 100 \%\,.
%\end{equation}
%
%In turn, the base photocurrent the under monochromatic illumination can be expressed  as follows \cite{Goetzberger1998}:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq4}
%     I_\mathrm{ph,b}=\frac{qF(1-R)\alpha L_n}{{\alpha}^2 L_n^2 - 1}\left( \alpha L_n - \frac{\frac{SL_n}{D_n}\left[ {\cosh\left( \frac{d^*}{L_n} \right)} - \exp(-\alpha d^*) \right] + \sinh\left( \frac{d^*}{L_n} \right) + \alpha L_n \exp(-\alpha d^*)}{\frac{SL_n}{D_n}\sinh\left( \frac{d^*}{L_n} \right) + \cosh\left( \frac{d^*}{L_n} \right)} \right)\,,
%\end{equation}
%where
%$F$ is the photon flux,
%$R$ is the reflection coefficient,
%$S$ is the surface recombination velocity,
%$L_n$ is the minority carrier (electron) diffusion length,
%$D_n$ is the electron diffusion coefficient,
%$d^*$ is the thickness of the quasi-neutral region base,
%since the space charge region (SCR) width for the modeled structures did not exceed 1~$\mu$m,
%it follows that $d^*\simeq d_p$.
%
%The recombination rate affects the value of $L_n$ and, according to the Shockley--Read--Hall model,
%depends on trap concentrations, capture cross-sections of electrons and holes, temperature, the Fermi level $E_\mathrm{F}$ location, and defect levels.
%Temperature also affects the values of $\alpha$ and $D_n$.
%In turn, the position of $E_\mathrm{F}$ within the band gap depends on temperature and doping level.
%Fig.~\ref{fig4} shows the calculated by using SCAPS temperature and concentration dependence of the Fermi level in the base of the investigated structure.
%In addition, this figure shows the positions of the levels associated with interstitial iron and the FeB pair.
%It is worth noting that Fe$_i$ acts as a deep center;
%the donor state of the Fe$_i$B$_s$ pair shows only negligible recombination activity,
%while the presence of the acceptor state Fe$_i$B$_s$ causes the
%carrier lifetime to be doping-dependent under low injection conditions \cite{FeB:Schmidt}.

%In our opinion, the change in sign and the monotonic decrease of $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$
%with increase in doping level value
%reflect the change in recombination activity caused by the Fermi level shift.

%at low boron concentrations, $E_\mathrm{F}$ in all points of the base is located below the donor level of Fe$_i$,
%while at $N_\mathrm{B}>10^{16}$~cm$^{-3}$,

%The weak dependence on base thickness indicates that the second term in parentheses in Eq.~(\ref{eq4}) is significantly smaller than the first.

%
%One can see that the theoretical dependencies of $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$
%on iron concentration and temperature qualitatively agree with the experimental results.
%To achieve quantitative agreement, a correction factor of $C_\mathrm{cor} = 1.4$ must be applied:
%the experimentally obtained value $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC,exp}$ should be replaced by $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC,exp} / C_\mathrm{cor}$ --- as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig5}.
%This methodology is frequently cited in the literature \cite{IronSC} and is associated with correcting specific systematic errors in simulations.
%
%As mentioned above, one of the primary objectives of this study is to assess the feasibility of utilizing
%changes in photoelectric parameters resulting from the dissociation of FeB pairs to estimate iron concentration.
%One of the most promising approaches in this regard is the application of machine learning algorithms.
%In this context, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ is expected to serve as one of the features.
%It is worth noting that a popular preprocessing technique involves standardizing feature values,
%where the distribution of each feature is transformed to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
%This approach ensures that multiplying the entire array of $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ values by a constant does not affect the resulting normalized values.
%
%In our case, simulation errors may arise because certain factors present in actual SSCs were not accounted for in the calculations, specifically:
%
%\noindent
%- the possible influence of series and shunt resistances;
%
%\noindent
%- the antireflective SiO$_2$ and passivating Si$_3$N$_4$ layers on the front surface induce a spectral dependence in reflectance, corresponding calculations necessitating the consideration of multiple reflections \cite{KostRefl2000};
%
%\noindent
%- the shading caused by electrodes;
%
%\noindent
%- the presence of defects unrelated to iron.
%
%
%Overall, the results indicate that relative changes in short-circuit current following the complete dissociation of FeB pairs
%can be used to estimate iron concentration:
%$\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ depends monotonically on $N_\mathrm{Fe}$, and its values can be pretty significant.
%In this context, determining the amount of impurity atoms is more appropriately conducted
%using photovoltaic parameters obtained under monochromatic illumination,
%as this method offers greater sensitivity (response amplitude of $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$).
%However, it should be noted that for low iron concentrations ($N_\mathrm{Fe}<10^{11}$~cm$^{-3}$)
%and solar cells with boron concentrations in the base around $10^{16}$~cm$^{-3}$,
%this approach appears to be unproductive.
%At these levels, there are blind spots in determining impurity metal concentrations.
%
%
%\subsection{Open-circuit voltage}
%
%Figure~\ref{fig7} presents the characteristic simulation results of open-circuit voltage changes due to the dissociation of FeB pairs.
%Figures~S7--S12 in the Supplementary Material show additional $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ dependencies.
%Notably, the changes in $V_\mathrm{OC}$ value are almost an order of magnitude smaller than the values observed for $I_\mathrm{SC}$.
%Moreover, differences in the behavior of open-circuit voltage changes as a function of iron concentration
%at low ($N_\mathrm{B}<2\times10^{16}$~cm$^{-3}$) base doping levels
%in the cases of monochromatic and AM1.5 illumination are noteworthy.
%Under solar illumination, $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ values are negative,
%and the $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC} \left(N_\mathrm{Fe}\right)$ dependency is non-monotonic --- see figs.~\ref{fig6}a,~\ref{fig6}b.
%Additionally, the base thickness significantly impacts the iron concentration,
%which correlates with the minimum $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ value (Fig.~\ref{fig6}a).
%When illuminated by photons with a wavelength of 940~nm, $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ values are positive and increase monotonically with iron concentration.
%As boron concentration increases, the behavior of $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}\left(N_\mathrm{Fe}\right)$ becomes similar, regardless of the type of illumination:
%the relative changes in open-circuit voltage during the rebuilding of iron-containing defects
%are negative and increase monotonically in absolute value with increasing both $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ and $N_\mathrm{B}$.
%Furthermore, changes in $V_\mathrm{OC}$ are more significant under monochromatic illumination, similar to the case of the short-circuit current.
%

%       Different surfaces correspond to different temperatures (a, c) and doping levels (b, d).
%}\label{fig6}
%\end{figure}
%
%The effect of temperature on $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ also depends on the base doping level:
%as $N_\mathrm{B}$ increases, the temperature coefficient of $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ gradually shifts from positive to negative.
%This trend is observed for both AM1.5 and 940nm illumination, as shown in Figs.~S9,~\ref{fig6}a, and \ref{fig6}b.
%The impact of $d_p$ on changes in open-circuit voltage is more significant than the effect observed for $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$.
%However, base thickness is not a determining factor for $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$;
%it mainly affects low doping levels and temperatures, as shown in Figs.~S9, S11, and S12.
%Another difference between the behavior of $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ and $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$
%is the former dependence on monochromatic illumination intensity.
%At $W_\mathrm{ill} = 10$~W/m$^{2}$, changes in open-circuit voltage are less significant,
%with differences increasing as iron concentration decreases and showing weak temperature dependence.
%
%Understanding the features of $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ requires recalling
%that the open-circuit voltage depends not only on the photocurrent
%but also on the saturation current $I_0$ and the ideality factor,
%which in turn are determined by the state of the defect subsystem and other parameters
%that varied in simulation \cite{Olikh2019SM,YangHandbookPVSi}.
%In the case of simplified single-diode model \cite{YangHandbookPVSi}:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq5}
%     V_\mathrm{OC} = nkT\left[ {\ln\left( {\frac{I_\mathrm{ph}}{I_0}} \right)+1} \right]\,.
%\end{equation}
%
%Similar to the photocurrent, we can express $I_\mathrm{0}$ as the sum of the currents from the base and the emitter \cite{Markvart}:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq6}
%     I_0 = I_\mathrm{0,e}+I_\mathrm{0,b}\,,
%\end{equation}
%and the second term can be expressed as follows \cite{Goetzberger1998}:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq7}
%     I_\mathrm{0,b}=\frac{qn_i D_n}{N_\mathrm{B}L_n}\cdot\frac{\frac{D_n}{SL_n}\sinh\left( \frac{d_p}{L_n} \right)+\cosh\left( \frac{d_p}{L_n} \right)}{\sinh\left( \frac{d_p}{L_n} \right)+\frac{D_n}{SL_n}\cosh\left( \frac{d_p}{L_n} \right)}\,,
%\end{equation}
%where
%$n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration.
%The last equation explains the observed dependence of $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ on the base thickness.
%
%It was shown \cite{Olikh2022PPV,Olikh2019SM} previously
%that changes in the ideality factor during restructuring Fe$_i$B$_\mathrm{Si}$ $\rightleftharpoons$ Fe$_i$ + B$_\mathrm{Si}$ do not exceed a few percent.
%This $n$ slight variation, combined with the logarithmic dependence of $V_\mathrm{OC}$ on $I_\mathrm{ph}$ as shown in Eq. (\ref{eq5}),
%explains the small absolute values of $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$.
%
%Schmidt \cite{FeB:Schmidt} attributes the non-monotonic dependence of $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}\left(N_\mathrm{Fe}\right)$
%(Fig.~\ref{fig6}b) to the significantly higher injection level in the cell base under open-circuit conditions
%compared to short-circuit conditions.
%Overall, the results support this hypothesis.
%In fact,
%for monochromatic illumination with significantly lower intensity,
%the injection level remains below the crossover point \cite{FeB:Schmidt} throughout the $I$--$V$ curve,
%which results in the absence of a minimum in the $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}\left(N_\mathrm{Fe}\right)$ dependence.
%
%The data presented in Fig.~\ref{fig7} compare the experimental and simulation results.
%Overall, the results in both cases is qualitatively consistent.
%However, to ensure that the absolute values are consistent, a correction factor dependent on iron concentration must be used.
%According to the data, $C_\mathrm{cor}$ is less than 1 for low values of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ and greater than 1 for high values.
%By the way, Schubert et al. \cite{IronSC} also observed such dependence of the correction factor.

%\end{figure}
%
%It is believed \cite{YangHandbookPVSi} that the main effect of metals on the $V_\mathrm{OC}$ values can be determined by shunt formation.
%However, SCAPS does not account for the effect of shunt resistance,
%which we believe is the primary reason for the discrepancies between experimental and simulated values.
%
%In summary, using relative changes in open-circuit voltage due to FeB pair dissociation is less convenient
%for estimating iron concentration compared to $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$.
%It is because of the smaller absolute values of $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$,
%the non-monotonic dependence of $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ on $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ under certain conditions,
%and the need for precise control over the intensity of monochromatic illumination.
%However, using $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ as an additional parameter alongside $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$
%can significantly enhance the accuracy of iron concentration measurements for $N_\mathrm{Fe}<10^{11}$~cm$^{-3}$
%and $N_\mathrm{B}=(1-5)\times10^{15}$cm$^{-3}$ under AM1.5 illumination.
%In this case, the dependence of $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ on $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ is sufficiently sharp (Fig.~\ref{fig6}b),
%and ambiguity in associating specific $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ values with iron concentration can be resolved
%by the monotonic behavior of $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ in this range.
%Notably, these boron concentrations are most relevant to typical real SSCs.
%
%
%
%\subsection{Fill factor}
%The fill factor is another defining term in the overall behavior of a solar cell.
%$F\!F$ is the ratio of the maximum obtainable power to the product of short circuit current and open-circuit voltage.
%In general, $F\!F$ depends on both $I_\mathrm{SC}$ and $V_\mathrm{OC}$.
%However, it can be shown that it is mainly determined by the $V_\mathrm{OC}$ value.
%Indeed, it is shown \cite{YangHandbookPVSi} within the single-diode model
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eqFF1}
%    F\!F \approx \frac{\upsilon_\mathrm{OC}-\ln\left(1+\upsilon_\mathrm{OC}\right)}{\upsilon_\mathrm{OC}+1} \,,
%\end{equation}
%with $\upsilon_\mathrm{OC}$ being the normalized open-circuit voltage
%$\upsilon_\mathrm{OC}=qV_\mathrm{OC}/nkT$.
%Another well--known empirical relation for the maximum achievable fill factor of a solar cell is proposed by Green \cite{Green1981,Green1982}:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eqFF2}
%    F\!F \approx \frac{\upsilon_\mathrm{OC}-\ln\left(0.72+\upsilon_\mathrm{OC}\right)}{\upsilon_\mathrm{OC}+1} \,.
%\end{equation}
%Thus, any factors that affect $V_\mathrm{OC}$ also impact the $F\!F$.
%However, since $V_\mathrm{OC}$ appears in both the numerator and denominator of Eqs.~(\ref{eqFF1})-(\ref{eqFF2}),
%the resulting changes in the fill factor are expected to be smaller than those in the open-circuit voltage.
%
%Recently, Bothe et al. \cite{Bothe2023} proposed explicit expressions for the $F\!F$ in terms of other key solar cell parameters.
%Specifically, for $p$--type SSCs and intrinsic limits, the parameterization can be expressed as follows:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eqFF3}
%    F\!F = \frac{90.4924}{d_p^{0.00220}}\left[0.9478+\frac{0.0519}{1+\left(\frac{\log N_\mathrm{B}}{17.3739 d_p^{-0.0093}}\right)^{76.3}}\right] \,,
%\end{equation}
%where
%$d_p$ is expected to be in micrometers.
%Additional recombination (e.g., Shockley–Read–Hall) leads to a decrease in $F\!F$ value \cite{Bothe2023}.
%
%Figs.~S13-S16 in the Supplementary Material, along with Fig.~\ref{fig8}, illustrate how the fill factor varies with iron defect variability.
%The following features of $\varepsilon F\!F$ can be identified from the presented data:

%\end{figure}
%
%\noindent
%- The changes in the fill factor are the smallest among the parameters considered,
%with maximum $\varepsilon F\!F$ values not exceeding 10\%;
%
%\noindent
%- At low boron concentrations ($N_\mathrm{B}<10^{16}$~cm$^{-3}$),
%the dependence of $\varepsilon F\!F$ on $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ is notably non-linear.
%Within the used concentration range, two regions of decrease and two regions of increase in $\varepsilon F\!F$ are observed;
%
%\noindent
%- At low boron concentrations, the change in fill factor value is positive and,
%in contrast to $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ and $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$,
%AM1.5 illumination causes more significant changes in $\varepsilon F\!F$ than monochromatic illumination.
%At high boron concentrations, the $\varepsilon F\!F$ is negative and does not exceed 4\%;
%
%
%\noindent
%- The absolute value of $\varepsilon F\!F$ increases, regardless of the value sign, with temperature increases;
%
%
%\noindent
%- Increasing the base thickness leads to a decrease in $\varepsilon F\!F$ (a reduction in the fill factor with increasing $d_p$ is expected according to (\ref{eqFF3})). Additionally, this results in a shift of the $\varepsilon F\!F\left(N_\mathrm{Fe}\right)$ dependence towards lower iron concentrations.
%The impact of $d_p$ is more pronounced at low boron concentrations and in the case of AM1.5 illumination;
%
%
%\noindent
%- In the case of monochromatic illumination, the light intensity significantly affects the relative changes in the fill factor
%($\varepsilon F\!F$ can vary by a factor of 2 when $W_\mathrm{ill}$ changes from 5 to 10~W/m$^{2}$).
%This impact is influenced by both iron concentration (which can even change the sign of the effect) and temperature.
%
%Fig.~\ref{fig9} shows that the experimental dependencies of  $\varepsilon F\!F\left(N_\mathrm{Fe}\right)$
%and $\varepsilon F\!F\left(T\right)$ align well with the calculated values.
%
%Figure~\ref{fig9} shows that the experimental dependencies $\varepsilon F\!F$$\left(N_\mathrm{Fe}\right)$ and $\varepsilon F\!F$$\left(T\right)$ are in good agreement with the calculated values.
%In our opinion, the quantitative agreement is limited by the relatively low accuracy of $\varepsilon F\!F$ measurements
%and the dependence of fill factor on series and shunt resistances \cite{Green1981,Green1982},
%which were not considered in the simulation.

%
%The observed characteristics of $\varepsilon F\!F$ suggest that
%the fill factor is considerably less suitable for estimating iron concentration in SSCs
%than the short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage.
%$\varepsilon F\!F$ can serve as an auxiliary parameter to refine $N_\mathrm{Fe}$;
%however, if monochromatic illumination is used, light intensity must be controlled with high precision.

%\subsection{Solar cell efficiency}
%
%Solar cell efficiency depends on all the photovoltaic conversion parameters previously discussed:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq11}
%    \eta = \frac{I_\mathrm{SC}V_\mathrm{OC}F\!F}{W_\mathrm{ill}A}\,,
%\end{equation}
%where
%$A$ is the illuminated area of the solar cell.
%Considering the differential of Eq.~(\ref{eq11}), a cumulative effect on the relative changes in efficiency can be anticipated.
%
%Considering the differential of formula (\ref{eq11}):
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq12}
%    d\eta = \frac{dI_\mathrm{SC}}{I_\mathrm{SC}}+\frac{dV_\mathrm{OC}}{V_\mathrm{OC}}+\frac{dF\!F}{F\!F},
%\end{equation}
%a cumulative effect on the relative changes in efficiency can be anticipated.
%Fig.~\ref{fig10} illustrates the simulation results for the solar cell efficiency,
%while Figs.~S17–S20 offer additional details in the Supplementary Material.

%}\label{fig10}
%\end{figure}
%
%The data indicate that the primary features of the $\varepsilon \eta$ dependencies
%on solar cell parameters and temperature align with those observed for $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$.
%However, a few differences are evident:
%1)~the amplitude of  $\varepsilon \eta$ is enhanced,
%reaching up to 50\% for AM1.5 and 200\% for 940~nm;
%these results align with the expectations from Eq.~(\ref{eq12})
%and make SC efficiency more convenient for iron concentration estimating;
%2)~for AM1.5, in the region $N_\mathrm{B}<5\times10^{15}$~cm$^{-3}$,
%a non-monotonic dependence of $\varepsilon \eta$$\left(N_\mathrm{Fe}\right)$ is observed,
%rendering it impossible to use relative changes in efficiency as the sole parameter for iron concentration estimating under specified conditions;
%3)~the existing dependence of $\varepsilon \eta$ on the intensity of the monochromatic illumination is weak,
%which does not prevent the use of $\varepsilon \eta$ for determining $N_\mathrm{Fe}$, even with not very precise $W_\mathrm{ill}$ measurements;
%4)~the temperature dependence of $\varepsilon \eta$ is weaker than that of $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$.
%
%
%Fig.~\ref{fig11} shows the experimental and simulated values of changes in the efficiency of the solar cell
%with a 380~$\mu$m base thickness and a doping concentration of $1.36\times10^{15}$~cm$^{-3}$.
%When presenting the experimental data, the same correction factor, $C_\mathrm{cor} = 1.4$, was applied as in the case of the short-circuit current.
%The data align closely, indicating that the inaccuracies typical for $V_\mathrm{OC}$ and $F\!F$  do not significantly contribute.

%
%The revealed characteristics of $\varepsilon \eta$ indicate that this photoelectric parameter
%is entirely suitable for estimating iron concentration.
%
%
%\subsection{Photoelectric parameters correlation}
%
%
%The previous subsections demonstrated that by using the relative changes in photovoltaic energy conversion parameters following the dissociation of FeB pairs
%(e.g., changes in short-circuit current),
%along with considering solar cell parameters (such as base depth and doping level)
%and measurement conditions (such as temperature and illumination type), it is possible to predict iron concentration.
%One approach to evaluating the value of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ is to apply a machine learning algorithm (random forest, gradient booster, or artificial neural network etc.).
%If we assume that training process is conducted separately for each illumination variant, the input set of descriptors could be
%($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$).
%Obviously, the $\varepsilon \eta$ value can be used simultaneously with $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ for a more accurate determination of iron concentration.
%Indeed, expanding the set of descriptors allows the incorporation of additional information, thereby improving prediction precision.
%However, when comparing Fig.~\ref{fig3} and Fig.~\ref{fig10}, it is clear that  $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$ and $\varepsilon \eta$ are not entirely independent.
%Therefore, with an input parameter set ($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$, $\varepsilon \eta$),
%we may be processing redundant data that offer no new or additional information regarding iron concentration.
%
%Analyzing their correlations can help evaluate the independence of the parameters.
%Fig.~\ref{fig12} presents the Pearson correlation coefficients calculated for all parameter sets.
%Additionally, it shows the correlation between iron concentration and each input parameter.
%It's worth noting that the $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ and $N_\mathrm{B}$ values in the logarithmic scale were used in calculations.
%It is a common approach for quantities that span several orders of magnitude \cite{Srivastava2023}.

%
%Firstly, it is noteworthy that, as indicated by the obtained data,
%the value of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ exhibits a weak correlation with each descriptor.
%Consequently, using any parameter in isolation from others is not feasible for precise iron concentration estimation.
%Regarding the descriptors associated with photovoltaic energy conversion,
%all of these parameters correlate strongly with the base doping level, except for open-circuit voltage under AM1.5 illumination.
%In addition, these parameters are substantially correlated with each
%other, which is particularly noticeable when using monochromatic illumination.
%Thus,  augmenting the descriptor set by incorporating relative changes in additional
%photoelectric parameters introduces substantial redundancy in the input data.
%
%
%To assess the redundancy of information, we can use principal component analysis (PCA),
%widely used in solving various problems, including identifying defects in solar cells \cite{Fadhel2019}.
%PCA uses a linear combination of the original variables to build the new variables (principal component, PC) while keeping maximum variance information.
%PCs are not correlating with each other and
%in the case of some particular principal component having a low information variance ratio, it can be discarded with little to no loss of useful information.
%
%PCs were built for different combinations of photovoltaic parameters and solar cell characteristics
%for the full set of simulated data, and the results are listed in Table~\ref{tbl2}.
%As evident, when only changes in short-circuit current are considered along with the solar cell's base parameters and temperature,
%there is no excessive information present.
%Adding $\varepsilon \eta$ to the set of descriptors practically does not change the number of independent variables.
%With the additional use of $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ values obtained under AM1.5 illumination, it is advisable to consider five independent variables.
%For the same set of descriptors in a monochromatic illumination case, one can limit oneself to using only four independent components
%(cumulative variance ratio for PC4 and PC5 does not exceed 1.3\%).
%When considering changes in all photoelectric parameters due to complete dissociation of Fe$_i$B$_s$ pairs,
%the actual number of independent variables is six for AM1.5 illumination and five for 940 nm lighting.

\section{Conclusion}

%We have provided the results of modeling the impact of variations in the
%state of iron impurities on the photovoltaic parameters of silicon solar cells
%with different base properties under various external conditions
%(temperature, intensity, and spectral composition of illumination).
%The simulation results have been compared with experimental data.
%
%The feasibility of using relative changes in short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage,
%fill factor, and efficiency resulting from the dissociation of FeB pairs
%to estimate the concentration of iron impurities in a solar cell has been analyzed.
%It is shown that changes in short-circuit current are the most suitable parameter.
%It is more expedient to determine the photovoltaic parameters under monochromatic illumination
%with a wavelength matching the predominant absorption in the solar cell base rather than using AM1.5 illumination.
%Next in suitability are changes in efficiency and open-circuit voltage,
%although their use becomes restricted at low doping levels of the base ($<10^{16}$~cm$^{-3}$).
%In our opinion, using the fill factor to estimate iron concentration is not practical.
%
%It has been shown that the potential accuracy of estimating iron concentration depends
%on the doping level of the base:
%at a boron concentration around $10^{16}$~cm$^{-3}$, it is minimal,
%while decreasing or increasing this value enhances the response of $I_\mathrm{SC}$ to the presence of iron.
%Furthermore, the accuracy of $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ determination is significantly influenced by the availability
%of precise information on the doping level of the base,
%as well as the accuracy of estimating the intensity of monochromatic illumination,
%especially when using $\varepsilon \eta$ and $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$.
%
%At the same time, $\varepsilon \eta$ and $\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$ can serve as additional parameters
%for refining the determination of iron concentration.
%In our opinion, for estimating iron concentration through changes
%in photovoltaic parameters due to variability in iron-related defects, it is advisable to use a set of
%($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$, $\varepsilon \eta$) or ($T$, $d_p$, $N_\mathrm{B}$, $\varepsilon I_\mathrm{SC}$, $\varepsilon \eta$,$\varepsilon V_\mathrm{OC}$).
%In these cases, to expedite calculations, it is advisable to use principal component analysis to reduce
%the number of variables while retaining the maximum variance information.
