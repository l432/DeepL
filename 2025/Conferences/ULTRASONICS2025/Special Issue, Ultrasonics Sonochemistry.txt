Dear Prof. Capelo,


Sincere thanks for all your work in organizing ULTRASONICS. It has been running successfully for so many years! I would also like to thank you for your support — it means a great deal to us. Sound waves may not be as reliable a means of communication as fiber optic cables, but they have still allowed us to share our ideas with the scientific community.

1.- Title (preliminary):
Ultrasound-Assisted Engineering of Si/Polymer Structures

2.- Authors (preliminary):
O. Olikh, D. Kalyuzhny, V. Kozachenko, S. Kondratenko

3.- Abstract (preliminary):
The influence of ultrasound loading during the fabrication of silicon-PEDOT:PSS structures was experimentally studied to control interface properties. Admittance spectroscopy, current-voltage, and capacitance-voltage measurements revealed that ultrasound modifies the defect structure, with the effects depending on the type of acoustic waves. The application of longitudinal waves reduces the relative concentration of deep-level traps in the space charge region, thereby improving the stability of the structures under aging. In contrast, radial waves increase the contribution of deep traps to recombination processes in the space charge region and shift defect levels further from the valence band.

P.S. The photos are wonderful! I truly regret that I couldn’t be there to be part of them.

Щиро дякую вам за вашу роботу з організації ULTRASONICS. Вона успішно продовжується вже стільки років! Також дякую за підтримку - це дуже важливо для нас. Звукові хвилі хоч і не настільки надійний засіб зв'язку, як оптоволоконні кабелі, проте дозволили  передати наші повідомлення науковій спільноті. 




P.S. Фотографії надзвичайні! Дуже шкодую, що не мав можливості опинитися на них.

First of all, thank you so much for your support of Ukraine. It is truly heartening to hear about your efforts — every contribution matters, and your help is greatly appreciated.

Regarding the special issue of Ultrasonics Sonochemistry, I completely understand your concerns. Indeed, our work reflects only the early-stage aspects of industrial applications. At the same time, we are certain that our research is not suitable for submission to the Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine, as it is not related to medical ultrasound.

Nevertheless, given that our study contributes to understanding and developing ultrasonic technologies with potential for industrial use, we would still be glad to submit it for consideration. Of course, the final decision remains with the editorial team.

Thank you once again for your support and your valuable feedback.

Heroyam Slava!

Best regards,
Oleh Olikh

Dear Prof. Capelo,

Our primary areas of scientific expertise include experimental studies of semiconductor structures, such as current-voltage, capacitance, and impedance measurements, as well as photoluminescence and  photoconductivity spectroscopies, photoacoustic, and photothermal techniques. We also conduct spectral and integral characterization of light sources, including LEDs. In addition, our research focuses on utilizing ultrasound for defect engineering, particularly on dynamic effects induced by ultrasonic loading of semiconductor systems. Machine learning is also applied for defect characterization.


Best regards,
Oleh Olikh
