I have estimated a budget of €10,000 for organizing one international conference, one boot camp, and one COST-like conference. If anyone thinks this amount is too high based on your experience in Europe, please let me know.

You should also consider the travel required for training members of our universities, whether they are formally part of the project or not. During the consortium’s time frame, around three to four team members will need to travel twice per year—once for the conference and once for the boot camp. These participants may vary each time.
