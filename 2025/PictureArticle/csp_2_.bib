    abstract = { This study applies a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D-DWT) analysis using a biorthogonal filter, followed by a continuous analysis employing an anisotropic Cauchy wavelet, on electroluminescence (EL) images of polycrystalline and monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) cells under varying current levels. The wavelet-based approach facilitates the identification of electrode-cell interfaces defects that are not readily visible in EL imaging alone. Our findings reveal that cells with poor soldering at electrode interfaces exhibit up to a 16.3\% reduction in maximum normalized power (MNP), directly correlating with reduced current density across certain busbars. The quantitative improvements in defect detection underscore the method's efficacy in addressing power inconsistencies tied to internal PV cell failures. This technique shows promise as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for assessing PV cell performance and structural integrity. }
