Computer vision-based method for quantifying iron-related defects in silicon solar cell



This study demonstrates the feasibility of employing transfer learning from pre-trained computer vision (CV) models to predict iron concentration in silicon solar cells, even when the available training datasets are extremely limited. The predictions are based on the kinetic dependencies of the short-circuit current following FeB pair dissociation, which were converted into images using a wavelet transformation. The performance of various combinations of CV models and regression algorithms was systematically analyzed. Specifically, several state-of-the-art CV architectures, including EfficientNetB7, MobileNetV2, NASNetLarge, ResNet152V2, Xception, and YOLOv4, were utilized either as classifiers or as feature extractors. Regression models, namely Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), were trained to predict iron concentration from the extracted features. Training and testing were performed using both simulated and experimental datasets. In both cases, EfficientNetB7 and NASNetLarge provided the most informative features for subsequent regression. Among the regression algorithms, SVR and DNNs were identified as the most effective. These models achieved MSE, MAPE, MedAPE, and R2 values of up to 0.001, 6%, 4%, and 0.999, respectively, for the simulated data, and 0.008, 10%, 5%, and 0.996 for the experimental data.
