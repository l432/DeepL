abstract = {As crystalline silicon solar cells approach their theoretical limit, a better understanding of the Auger recombination processes which define this limit is required, including at temperatures away from room temperature, where most solar modules operate. In this work, we apply a recently developed approach to measure the temperature dependence of the ambipolar Auger coefficient, Camb, in the range of 117–463 K at carrier concentrations relevant for solar cell operation. We observe a significant dependence of Camb on temperature, decreasing with increasing temperature in the measured range. We show that disagreement between the temperature dependence observed in previous works can be explained as resulting from differences in the carrier concentration range probed by different experiments, with our results showing good agreement with previous measurements performed at lower concentrations. This can be understood in terms of the temperature and carrier concentration dependence of the Coulomb enhancement factors. We develop a semi-empirical parameterisation of Auger recombination valid for arbitrary carrier concentrations and temperatures that extends the current established room-temperature model to incorporate the observed temperature dependence. We show that consideration of the temperature dependence of Auger recombination has significant consequences for the limiting efficiency of solar cells and modules at typical operating temperatures.}
