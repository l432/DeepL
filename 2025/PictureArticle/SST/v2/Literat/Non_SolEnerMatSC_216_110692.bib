abstract = {In the majority of studies involving injection dependent lifetime spectroscopy, it is assumed that the investigated defect is a single-level defect following Shockley-Read-Hall recombination statistics. Nevertheless, in real life, two-level defects or multi-level defects are more common than single-level defects. In this study, we first investigated the possible consequences of misinterpreting a two-level defect as two single-level defects. A procedure to properly fit two-level defects in lifetime spectroscopy is subsequently proposed. At the end, we use boron-oxygen related defects as an experimental demonstration. Our experimental results reveal that the recombination statistics of boron-oxygen related defects cannot be explained by the coexistence of two independent single-level defects. A two-level defect parameterization appears to be more suitable.}
