Dear Editors,

%Enclosed is a manuscript entitled “XXX XXXX XXXXX” by sb, which we are submitting for publication in the journal of …. We have chosen this journal because it deals with …
Enclosed with this letter you will find en electronic submission of manuscript entitled ``Influence of $\gamma$--irradiation and ultrasound treatment on carrier transport in Au–-SiO$_2$–-Si structure'' by A.~Gorb, O.~Korotchenkov, O.~Olikh, A.~Podolian, and R.~Chupryna.
This is an origin paper which has not
%neither previously nor
simultaneously in whole or in part been submitted anywhere else.
%Both authors have read and approved the final version submitted.
%No part of this paper has published or submitted elsewhere.
No conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript.

It is known that the electrical properties of semiconductor devices are determined by the crystal microstructure.
The present manuscript focused on silicon MOS structure, one of the most common forms of electronic devices used in application.
It has been experimentally observed that ultrasound treatment leads to radiation defect annealing and recovering of $\gamma$--degraded silicon MOS structure characteristics.
We believe that using ultrasound for defect engineering would be of interest to the journal’s readers.


%Mechano--sorptive is sometimes denoted as accelerated creep.
%It has been experimentally observed that the creep of parer accelerates if it is subjected to a cyclic moisture content.
%This is of large practical importance for the paper industry.
%The present manuscript describes a micromechanical model on the fibre network level that is able to capture the experimentally observed behaviour.
%In particular, the difference between mechano--sorptive creep in tension is analysed.


%The paper demonstrates [significant finding and its significance]. As such this paper should be of interest to a broad readership including those interested in [what kinds of research, topics, techniques – should be those targeted by the journal]
%We believe that sth would be of interest to the journal’s readers.

%Three potential independent reviewers who have excellent  knowledge about  this paper are
%1.Dr. Chen, University of Maine, email1@university.com

We would  very much appreciate if you would consider the manuscript for publication in the \emph{Solid State Electronics}.
%We appreciate your consideration of our manuscript, and we look forward to receiving comments from the reviewers.
