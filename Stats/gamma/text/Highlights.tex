\textbf{Highlights:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The acoustically induced nearly room--temperature annealing of
      $P_b$-- and $E'$---centres is observed
  \item Ultrasound treatment leads to narrowing of energy distribution of $\gamma$--induced traps at Si/SiO$_2$  interface
  \item The partial recovering of $\gamma$--degraded silicon MOS structure characteristics by acoustic waves is observed
\end{itemize}
