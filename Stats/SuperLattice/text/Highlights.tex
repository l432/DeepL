\textbf{Highlights:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The relationship between the diode ideality factor and the iron concentration in the base layer of silicon $n^+-p$ solar cells has been studied through computer simulation
  \item The algorithms of an iron concentration evaluation in a silicon solar cell by using a current--voltage curve have been proposed
  \item The analytic expressions have been suggested and the calibration curves have been are calculated
\end{itemize}
