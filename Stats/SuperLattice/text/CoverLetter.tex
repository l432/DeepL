Dear Editors,

%Enclosed is a manuscript entitled “XXX XXXX XXXXX” by sb, which we are submitting for publication in the journal of …. We have chosen this journal because it deals with …
Enclosed with this letter you will find en electronic submission of manuscript entitled
``Relationship between the ideality factor and the iron concentration in silicon solar cells'' by Oleg Olikh.

This is an origin paper which has not simultaneously in whole or in part been submitted anywhere else.
No conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript.

It is well known that impurities are crucial for the solar cells performance.
There are many experimental methods for solving this problem, such as the infrared spectroscopy, deep level transient spectroscopy, photoluminescence,
thermally stimulated capacitance and current, secondary ion mass spectrometry etc.
These methods are complicated  enough and demand a special setup.
At the same time, the analysis of  the current--voltage  characteristic is commonly used  to characterize the solar cell.
The present manuscript describes a method of a contaminant concentration evaluation by using an ideality factor value, which extracted from current--voltage curve.
The method are based on results of a numerical simulation of solar cells.
I believe that such way of defect characterisation would be of interest to the journal’s readers.



I would  very much appreciate if you would consider the manuscript for publication in the \emph{Superlattices and Microstructures}.
%We appreciate your consideration of our manuscript, and we look forward to receiving comments from the reviewers.
