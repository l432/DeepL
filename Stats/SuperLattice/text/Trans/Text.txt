Relationship between the ideality factor and the iron concentration in silicon solar cells



Abstract
The ideality factor value of silicon $n^+-p$ solar cells with a various iron contaminant has been studied by means of computer simulation.
An iron concentration range of $10^{10}-10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$, a base doping level range of $10^{15}-10^{17}$~cm$^{-3}$, and a temperature range of $290-340$~K were under study.
The Solar Cells Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS) has been the tool used for numerical simulation of these devices.
The two--diode model was used to extract an  ideality factor.
The Shockley--Read--Hall recombination, the Auger recombination, the radiative recombination, the unpaired interstitial iron, and
the iron--boron pair were under consideration.
The algorithms of an iron concentration evaluation in a silicon solar cell by using a current--voltage curve have been proposed.
The analytic expressions have been suggested and the calibration curves have been are calculated.

Introduction

It is well known that impurities are crucial for the semiconductor devices performance.
It is completely relevant to solar cell (SC) as well.
Dopants determinate an internal electric field, which leads to a separation of light-generated carriers and a photovoltage generation.
Contaminants act often as a highly effective recombination centre, reducing the carrier lifetime and SC efficiency.
Therefore the impurity concentration determination is a very important problem.
There are many experimental methods for solving this problem, such as the infrared spectroscopy, deep level transient spectroscopy, photoluminescence,
thermally stimulated capacitance and current, secondary ion mass spectrometry etc \cite{Schroder2006}.
These methods are complicated  enough and demand a special setup.

At the same time, the analysis of  the current--voltage ($I-V$)  characteristic is commonly used  to characterize the solar cell.
Thus, the dark $I-V$ curve normally serves as a first diagnosis of SC recombination \cite{Grover}.
The $I-V$  equation that models the SC by an equivalent electrical circuit contains several parameters related to physical phenomena occurring in the device.
It is obviously that these parameters depend on impurities, but the interrelations are intricate sufficiently.
As a result, $I-V$ curves are not used practically for a contaminant diagnosis, although the possibility of simultaneous calibrate both SC performance and impurity looks quite attractive.

One of a number of parameters of SC model is the ideality factor $n$.
The value of $n>1$ indicates that there are traps involved in a carrier recombination mechanism in solar cells.
If the defect related recombination  is dominant than the value $n=2$ is often stated in a literature.
But when the value of $n$ approaches 2, it suggests the  very specific  assumptions about  the  energy levels  (middle  of  the  bandgap) and  capture  cross sections  (equal for electrons and  holes)  of  the recombination centres in a symmetrically  doped diode which lead to $n=2$ \cite{n2Kuhn,n2_Beier}.
Typically, the value of the ideality factor ranges from 1 to 2 for real devices and
depends on ambient conditions and the recombination center parameters, including a trap concentration \cite{n2_Beier,n2McIntosh,n2Kaminski,HAMEIRI2013251,Heide}.
Thus, the ideality factor is an important parameter that can describe the electrical behavior of photovoltaic devices
and is used to characterize the recombination in SC \cite{Duan}.


The aim of our work is to investigate a possibility of  a contaminant concentration evaluation by using an ideality factor value.
The heuristic approach is used and its milestones can be expressed as following:
i)~the dark $I-V$ characteristic of the SCs with known contaminant composition is simulated;
ii)~the obtained characteristic is fitted according to the double--diode model and the ideality factor is determined;
iii)~the initial impurity concentration and the calculated ideality factor value are used for acquisition of analytic or grading dependencies.

As a first approximation, the paper considers a fairly simple but practically important system.
Namely, the crystalline silicon SC and iron impurity were under consideration.
Si photovoltaic device cover almost 90\% of global SC market.
Iron is a major contaminant due to the wide use of stainless steel equipment in the fabrication line and one of the most detrimental metal impurities in solar--grade crystalline silicon materials \cite{Istratov1999,FeB:Schmidt,ZHU2016192}.

Numerical simulation is carried out by using the one--dimensional code SCAPS \cite{SCAPS1,SCAPS2}.
This software is widely used to modeling of various solar cells \cite{SCAPSuse1,SCAPSuse2,SCAPSuse3,SCAPSuse5,SCAPSuseSi1,SCAPSuseSi4,SCAPSuseSi3},
including silicon based devices \cite{SCAPSuseSi1,SCAPSuseSi3,SCAPSuseSi4}.

Simulation details

The simple $n^+-p$ structure as  shown in inset in Fig.~\ref{figIV} is used in the present calculation.
with the initial thickness of each layer $d_n=0.5$~$\mu$m and $d_p=300$~$\mu$m, respectively.
$n^+$ is the emitter layer with $N_\mathrm{D}=10^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ while $10^{15}-10^{17}$~cm$^{-3}$ is the $N_\mathrm{A}$ of the $p$ base layer.
The $p$ base layer is uniformly doped with boron.

The simulations  were carried out over a temperature range of $290\div330$~K.
The temperature dependencies of bandgap and carrier mobility are calculated, respectively,  according to Varshni and Caughey--Thomas equations \cite{Schroder2006}.
The bandgap narrowing is considered as described by the Slotboom equation \cite{Markvart,ZHOU20188}.
The density of states in the conduction/valence band ($N_C$/$N_V$) and thermal carrier velocities are from Green \cite{Nc:Green}.


The iron is considered as a base layer uniform contaminant with the concentration $10^{10}-10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$.
The iron atoms are known to be predominantly located in interstitial lattice position in silicon.
The donor level $E_{\mathrm{Fe}_i} = E_V+0.394$~eV is associated with $\mathrm{Fe}_i$ \cite{Rein2,MurphyJAP2011}.
Therefore neutral  $\mathrm{Fe}_i^0$ and ionized $\mathrm{Fe}_i^+$  interstitial are observed in  Si.
In $p$--type material, $\mathrm{Fe}_i^+$ readily interacts with ionized shallow acceptors.
In our simulation, the pair $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$ must be under consideration.
On the one hand, this pair is bistable defect and the trigonal and the orthorhombic configurations are feasible.
On the other hand, the orthorhombic pair is only observable at low temperature ($<150$~K) under an illumination or carrier injection condition \cite{Narland,Sakauchi}.
Besides,  the $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$ pairs can be readily dissociated by 15 to 90~s illumination with a halogen lamp \cite{FeB:Schmidt}.
The association reaction is diffusion limited and can take place under dark condition during tens minute \cite{FeB:kinetic}.
Two following cases were under simulation.


i)~The negligible proportion of Fe present in the form of $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$ pairs is assumed:
    N_{\mathrm{Fe}}=N_{\mathrm{Fe}_i^0}+N_{\mathrm{Fe}_i^+} \,,
where
$N_{\mathrm{Fe}_i^0}$ and $N_{\mathrm{Fe}_i^+}$ are the concentrations of  neutral and ionized iron respectively.
This is a safe assumption for cells operating under constant illumination or after illumination stop immediately.
The hole and electron capture cross--sections of defect are calculated according to
$\sigma_{p,\mathrm{Fe}_i}=3.85\times10^{-16}\exp(-\frac{0.045}{kT})$~cm$^2$ and
$\sigma_{n,\mathrm{Fe}_i}=9.1\times10^{-15}\exp(-\frac{0.024}{kT})$~cm$^2$ \cite{Istratov1999,Rein2,MurphyJAP2011}.
$E_{\mathrm{Fe}_i}$ is taken as the temperature independent value \cite{Kohno}.
This case is labeled ``FI'' from now on.

ii)~The equilibrium condition is assumed and the total dissolved iron concentration is given by a sum of concentrations of three separate species
    N_{\mathrm{Fe}}=N_{\mathrm{Fe}_i^0}+N_{\mathrm{Fe}_i^+}+N_{\mathrm{FeB}} \,,
where $N_\mathrm{FeB}$ is the $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$ pair concentration.
The using of the relationships between the equilibrium concentration of $\mathrm{Fe}_i^+$, $\mathrm{Fe}_i^0$, and  $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$ from \cite{MurphyJAP2011,FeB:kinetic}
leads to the following expression
    N_{\mathrm{FeB}}=N_{\mathrm{Fe}}\frac{N_\mathrm{A}10^{-23}\exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{kT}\right)}
where
$F$ is the Fermi level,
$E_b$ is the binding energy of the $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$ pairs (taken as 0.582 eV).
Hence it should be taken under account the uniform distribution of the $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$ pair.
In our simulation, first, the Fermi level position in the base layer is calculated for each doping level as well as temperature.
Then, Eq.~(\ref{eqNFeB}) is used to calculate the $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$ pair distribution.
The representative example of calculation is shown in Fig.~\ref{figDist}.



The trigonal $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$ pair is considered, a true condition under room temperature.
This pair is amphoteric defect.
In the present work, the parameters of donor ($E_{\mathrm{FeB}}^{d} = E_V+0.10$~eV,
$\sigma_{p,\mathrm{FeB}}^d=2\times10^{-14}$~cm$^2$,
$\sigma_{n,\mathrm{FeB}}^d=4\times10^{-13}$~cm$^2$)
and  acceptor ($E_{\mathrm{FeB}}^{a} = E_C-0.26$~eV,
$\sigma_{p,\mathrm{FeB}}^a=5.5\times10^{-15}$~cm$^2$,
$\sigma_{n,\mathrm{FeB}}^a=2.5\times10^{-15}$~cm$^2$)
levels are used from \cite{Istratov1999,Rein2,MurphyJAP2011,FeB:kinetic}.
This case is labeled ``FIFB'' from now on.

Only a bulk recombination is under consideration in the paper.
Once again two cases were simulated.
In the first one, labeled ``SRH'', the Shockley--Read--Hall recombination is taken into account only.
In the second one, denoted ``SRHBBA'', the both Shockley--Read--Hall recombination and intrinsic recombination are allowed for.
The electron and hole Auger recombination factors ($C_n=2.8\times10^{-31}$~cm$^6$s$^{-1}$ and $C_p=9.9\times10^{-32}$~cm$^6$s$^{-1}$)
and radiative band--to--band recombination coefficient ($B=1.8\times10^{-15}$~cm$^3$s$^{-1}$)
are taken from \cite{Markvart}.

So, four different data sets (FI--SRH, FI--SRHBBA, FIFB--SRH, and FIFB--SRHBBA)
have been simulated for solar cell.




The dark forward $I-V$ characteristic were generated by SCAPS over a voltage range up to $0.62$~V.
The $I-V$ curve example is shown in Fig.~\ref{figIV}.

The real silicon SCs are often described by so--called two--diode model \cite{Breitenstein2013}.
The first diode represents the ``ideal'' diode, describing the so--called diffusion current, characterized by a saturation current $I_{01}$,
and the second diode is the so--called recombination current, characterized by a saturation current $I_{02}$ and an ideality factor $n$ \cite{Breitenstein2013}.
According to the two--diode model, the dark SC current is given by
    I=I_{01}\left[\exp\left(-\frac{qV}{kT}\right)-1\right]+ I_{02}\left[\exp\left(-\frac{qV}{nkT}\right)-1\right]\,.
It should be noted that the influence of series resistance as well as shunt resistance is neglected in Eq.~(\ref{eqIV}).
We used Eq.~(\ref{eqIV}) to fit the simulated data taking $n$, $I_{01}$, and $I_{02}$ as the fitting parameters and more attention was paid to the ideality factor value.
The fitting result is shown in Fig.~\ref{figIV}.

All non-linear fittings in the paper were done by using the differential evolution method \cite{DE:Sun,DEWang}.
The least--squares method was used to linear fitting.



Results and Discussion
Interstitial iron, SRH recombination

Some data, calculated in the FI--SRH case, are shown in Fig.~\ref{figA}(a,b).
One can see that the ideality factor  increases monotonically with the doping level increase.
While temperature dependence of the  $n$  is more intricate: it contains the both increasing and decreasing components and the contribution of the last one rises with  increase in $N_\mathrm{A}$.
The iron concentration increase leads to  the increase in $n$ value and does not change $n(N_\mathrm{A},T)$ dependence --- see Fig.~\ref{figA} and Supplementary Material.
It is evidence of for possibilities of  $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ evaluation by using $n$.
Only low doping level value ($N_\mathrm{A}\cong10^{15}$~cm$^{-3}$)and high temperature ($T>300$~K) are exclusion
because $n\cong1$ is expected accordingly to the simulation.



It is clear that an analytical expression would be more convenient way to the $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ evaluation.
To build such expression one has to take into account that the interstitial iron captures an electron in $p$--type silicon.
Therefore the recombination affectivity is determined by a hole occurrence  on the $\mathrm{Fe}_i$ level.
The hole occupation probability is $f_p=\left[1+\exp\left(\frac{F-E_{\mathrm{Fe}_i}}{kT}\right)\right]^{-1}$
and this equation can be a start point to build an expression $n=n(T,N_\mathrm{A},N_\mathrm{Fe})$.
It must be considered that, unlike the simulated  $n(N_\mathrm{A},T)$ relationship,
$f_p(N_\mathrm{A},T)$ depends on temperature monotonically and reaches saturation with the increase in $N_\mathrm{A}$ --- see Supplementary Material.
In addition, the Fermi level can be evaluated by the equation $(F-E_V)=kT\ln(N_V/N_\mathrm{A})$ under the simulation conditions.

Based on aforesaid, we search expression $n=n(T,N_\mathrm{A},N_\mathrm{Fe})$ in the following form:

    n(T,N_\mathrm{A},N_\mathrm{Fe})=1+\frac{n_0(N_\mathrm{Fe})\cdot T^{m_T}\cdot(\log N_\mathrm{A})^{m_\mathrm{A}}}
        {1+N_V(T)\cdot\gamma(N_\mathrm{A},N_\mathrm{Fe})\cdot\exp\left(\frac{E_\mathrm{ef}(T,N_\mathrm{A})}{kT}\right)}\,,
where
$m_T$ and $m_\mathrm{A}$ are the constant,
and fitness parameters $n_0$, $\gamma$, and $E_\mathrm{ef}$ depend on iron concentration, doping level, and temperature.

The analysis has shown that the simulated data are well fitted by Eq.~(\ref{eqMain}) with $m_T=1.13$, $m_\mathrm{A}=2.85$, $\gamma=N_\mathrm{A}^{-1}$.
Besides, the dependence of the effective energy $E_\mathrm{ef}$ can be expressed as:

    E_\mathrm{ef}(T,N_\mathrm{A})=E_0-\alpha\, T / \log N_\mathrm{A}+\beta \,T\,,

where
values $E_0=1.43\pm0.08$~eV, $\alpha=85\pm5$~meV$\,$cm$^{-3}$K$^{-1}$, and $\beta=1.9\pm0.2$~meV$\,$K$^{-1}$ do not depend on $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ practically.
The parameters are listed in Table~\ref{tabEq} and the results of the fitting are shown in Fig.~\ref{figA}(c,d), and Supplementary Material.
A good agreement of  simulated data and fitting curves prove the expediency of Eq.~(\ref{eqMain}) using.


Thus, in the FI--SRH case, the simulated (semi--empirical) dependence of the ideality factor takes the following shape:

    n=1+\frac{n_0(N_\mathrm{Fe})\cdot T^{1.13}\cdot(\log N_\mathrm{A})^{2.85}}
        {1+\frac{N_V(T)}{N_\mathrm{A}}\cdot\exp\left(\frac{1.43}{kT}-\frac{986}{\log N_\mathrm{A}}+22\right)}\,.

We use Eq.~(\ref{eqM-FISRH}) by taking $n_0$ as fitting parameter to fit the $n$ dependencies, calculated for different $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ value.
The resulting $n_0$ dependence on iron concentration is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig4}.
This curve is monotonic as well as  smooth enough and can serves as a calibration curve.
In addition, the found dependence is well described by Eq.~(\ref{eqN0}):
    n_0(N_\mathrm{Fe})=1.28\times10^{-7}-\frac{2.38\times10^{-8}}{1+\left(\frac{N_\mathrm{Fe}}{4.96\times10^{12}}\right)^{0.85}}\,.


Thus, the algorithm of an iron concentration evaluation in a silicon SC by using a $I-V$ curve can be as following.
i) The solar cell is illuminated by 15 to 90 s with a halogen lamp to dissociate the FeB pairs.
      When illumination stopped, the $I-V$ characteristic is measured.
ii) $I-V$ curve is fitted accordingly to the two--diode model and the ideality factor $n$ is determined.
iii) Taking into account $n$ value, doping level $N_\mathrm{A}$, and measurement temperature,
      the parameter $n_0$ is calculated by relationship
    n_0=(n-1)\cdot \frac{1+\frac{N_V(T)}{N_\mathrm{A}}\cdot\exp\left(\frac{1.43}{kT}-\frac{986}{\log N_\mathrm{A}}+22\right)}{T^{1.13}\cdot(\log N_\mathrm{A})^{2.85}}\,.

iv) $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ is evaluated by using the calibration curve in Fig.~\ref{fig4} or by the following expression
    N_\mathrm{Fe}=4.96\times10^{12}\cdot \left(\frac{2.38\times10^{-8}}{1.28\times10^{-7}-n_0}\right)^{1.18}\,.


Interstitial iron, SRH recombination, intrinsic recombination


It should be noted that the taking into consideration of the Auger recombination and band--to--band recombination  cause to modification in the above  algorithm.
In fact, the simulation show that the dependencies $n(N_\mathrm{A},T)$ are changed partially --- see Fig.~\ref{fig5}.
It is quite expectable that these changes rise with the $N_\mathrm{A}$ increase and the $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ decrease.
Besides, the non--monotonic dependencies $n(N_\mathrm{A},T)$ are observed at the low iron concentration value.
Thus, the search for an analytical expression, qualified for the each temperature and doping level values, seems inappropriate.


On the other hand, since room temperature measurements of $I-V$ characteristics alone cannot provide detailed information about the SC properties,
additional insight is often gained by characterising the devises over a temperature range.
Therefore in this case, we try to evaluate the iron concentration by using the ideality factor temperature dependence,
which is measured (simulated)  for the solar cell with  the known constant doping level --- $n(T)\mid_{N_\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{const}}$.

Some of the obtained curves $n(T)$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig6}.
One can see that the $N_\mathrm{A}$ value affects substantively on temperature dependence of the ideality factor.
We use Eq.~(\ref{eqMain})  and value $m_\mathrm{A}=2.85$ to fit the simulated $n$ temperature dependence.
A close agreement between simulated and fitted data has been found with help $m_T=1.3$ and $E_\mathrm{ef}=(9.53-0.52\log N_\mathrm{A})$ --- see lines in Fig.~\ref{fig6}.


The values of the both another parameters $n_0$ and $\gamma$ depend on doping level as well as iron concentration and can be used to evaluate $N_\mathrm{Fe}$.
So, as it is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig7}(a), the dependencies $\gamma(N_\mathrm{Fe})$ can be described by the following equation:

    \gamma=\left(\frac{10^{15}}{N_\mathrm{A}}\right)^{11}\cdot \frac{\eta N_0+N_\mathrm{Fe}}{N_0+N_\mathrm{Fe}}\,.

where
$10\div15$ and $(0.5\div1)\times10^{12}$~cm$^{-3}$ are the $\eta$ and $N_0$, respectively, at various boron concentration.



The concentration dependencies of the parameter $n_0$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig7}(b) and can serve as a calibration curves as well.
As shown in figure, the iron concentration evaluation by using the $n_0$ value is advisable for a high base doping level($N_\mathrm{A}>10^{16}$~cm$^{-3}$).
At low $N_\mathrm{A}$ value the weak dependence $n_0$ on $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ impairs the estimation accuracy.
Simultaneously, the opposite case is observed for parameter $\gamma$ and
it is better to evaluate  $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ by the $\gamma$ value at a low doping level,
Otherwise the $\gamma$ decreases significantly (see Eq.~(\ref{eqGamma})) and the accuracy of $\gamma$ determination by Eq.~(\ref{eqMain}) fitting falls.


Iron--boron pair and interstitial iron

The results, obtained under an equilibrium condition and $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$ presence, are illustrated by Fig.~\ref{fig8}.
The main features of the ideality factor change are obviously to be in agree with the case of $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$ absent.
Namely, there are $n$ increase with increase in $N_\mathrm{Fe}$, the $n(T)$ dependence non--monotony, which pronounced with decrease in $N_\mathrm{A}$, etc.
First of all, these are because Fermi level is far from the valence band, the neutral  interstitial $\mathrm{Fe}_i^0$ is dominant,
and the boron contained complex  is  not created within a space charge region (SCR) --- see Fig.~\ref{figDist}.
That is, unlike the quasi neutral region, the illumination does not cardinally change  the $N_{\mathrm{Fe}_i}$ and $N_{\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s}$ ratio.
On the other hand, the SCR recombination defines the value of ideality factor mainly.
But the $n$ absolute  value  is smaller in FIFB--case then that in the FI--case because $\mathrm{Fe}_i$ and $\mathrm{Fe}_i\mathrm{B}_s$ have different energy levels and cross--sections for recombination.
Comparison of Fig.~\ref{fig8}(a) and Fig.~\ref{fig8}(c) as well as  comparison of Fig.~\ref{fig8}(b) and Fig.~\ref{fig8}(d)
shows that intrinsic recombination affects the $n$ value at a low iron concentration, and high temperature, and high doping level.



As in previous FI-SRHBBA case, the different $n(N_\mathrm{A}, T)$ dependencies are observed at the different $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ values.
As in previous case, the ideality factor temperature dependencies $n(T)\mid_{N_\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{const}}$ are under consideration
and we use Eq.~(\ref{eqMain}) to fit simulated data.
It has been found that the simulated data are in good agreement with the fitting curves (see Supplementary Material) for values
$m_T=2.2$ and $E_\mathrm{ef}$, which were linear dependent of $\log N_\mathrm{A}$ and were listed in Table~\ref{tabEq}.

The obtained dependencies of parameters $\gamma$ and $n_0$ on iron concentration are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig9} and Fig.~\ref{fig10}, respectively,
and can serve as a calibration curves as well.
Again, it is more appropriate to use the parameter $\gamma$ for $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ evaluation at low boron concentrations and the parameter $n_0$ in the opposite case.
However, the conditional limit shifts toward the smaller $N_\mathrm{A}$ values and is about $3\times10^{15}$~cm$^{-3}$.
Again, the main difference between calibration curves in the FIFB--SRH and FIFB--SRHBBA cases is observed for $N_\mathrm{A}<10^{11}$~cm$^{-3}$ and $N_\mathrm{A}>3\times10^{16}$~cm$^{-3}$.



Thus, the another, more complicated but more general, algorithm of an iron concentration evaluation can be offered.

i) The dark $I-V$ characteristics of the silicon SC are measured over over a temperature range of about $290-340$~K.
The measurements can be carried out  after a halogen lamp illumination or after long--term storing in the dark.
ii) $I-V$ curves are fitted accordingly to the two--diode model and the temperature dependency of the ideality factor $n(T)$ is determined.
iii) Eq.~(\ref{eqMain}) and Table~\ref{tabEq} are used to fit the $n(T)$.
 The $n_0$ and $\gamma$ are taken as the fitting parameters.
iv) $N_\mathrm{Fe}$ is evaluated by using calibration curves in Fig.~\ref{fig7} or in Figs.~\ref{fig9}(b) and ~\ref{fig10}(b) in the
 after illumination or after dark storing measurement cases, respectively.


Conclusion
The relationship between the diode ideality factor and the iron concentration in the base layer of silicon $n^+-p$ solar cells has been studied through computer simulation.
An iron concentration range of $10^{10}-10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$, a base doping level range of $10^{15}-10^{17}$~cm$^{-3}$, and a temperature range of $290-340$~K were under study.
The results obtained in this work show that the ideality factor value can serve to estimate a contaminant concentration.
So, the analysis has shown that in the case of the Shockley--Read--Hall recombination and the unpaired interstitial iron,
single $I-V$ characteristic measurement and single ideality factor extraction  are needed.
If the Auger recombination, the radiative recombination, or the iron--boron pair presence have to be taking into account,
then measurements over a temperature range are needed.
The calibration curves have been are calculated and the analytic expressions have been suggested.

However we should note the following.
The simplified task was under consideration and the set of variables consisted of three values (temperature, doping level, iron concentration) only.
But the analytical expression was found in the  approximation case only.
As simulation has shown, the  geometry of the solar cell (e.g. base layer thickness) affected value of ideality factor as well.
In general case, the ideality factor can be used to estimate not only a trap concentration but also an energy level and a capture cross--section.
But such multivariable problem would lead to a a huge set of calibration curves.
On the other hand, the artificial neural networks seem to be good for this task.

Cover Letter

Dear Editors,

Enclosed with this letter you will find en electronic submission of manuscript entitled
``Relationship between the ideality factor and the iron concentration in silicon solar cells'' by Oleg Olikh.

This is an origin paper which has not simultaneously in whole or in part been submitted anywhere else.
No conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript.

It is well known that impurities are crucial for the solar cells performance.
There are many experimental methods for solving this problem, such as the infrared spectroscopy, deep level transient spectroscopy, photoluminescence,
thermally stimulated capacitance and current, secondary ion mass spectrometry etc.
These methods are complicated  enough and demand a special setup.
At the same time, the analysis of  the current--voltage  characteristic is commonly used  to characterize the solar cell.
The present manuscript describes a method of a contaminant concentration evaluation by using an ideality factor value, which extracted from current--voltage curve.
The method are based on results of a numerical simulation of solar cells.
I believe that such way of defect characterisation would be of interest to the journal’s readers.



I would  very much appreciate if you would consider the manuscript for publication in the \emph{Superlattices and Microstructures}.

Sincerely yours,

Oleg~Olikh
