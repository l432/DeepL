\section{Introduction}
It has been shown experimentally that ultrasound (US) can effectively interact with defects.
US as defect engineering tool has some advantages:
(i)~locality of the action due to the predominant absorption in regions of deviation in the lattice periodicity;
(ii)~selectivity of the influence, which is achieved by variation of ultrasonic wave (USW) polarization and type;
(iii)~possibility of resonance transformations in the defect system due to the oscillation nature of process action.
(iv)~capability of reversible effect, which is observed in the low intensity USW utilization case.

In the case of piezoelectric semiconductors, the acousto--defect interaction (ADI) is determined mainly by electric field, which accompanies the vibration wave propagation.
This effect is expected and is something related to acousto--electric phenomena.
But US influence on defect system is also observed in non--piezoelectric crystals like silicon, which is dominant material in microelectronic.
Thus it is experimentally observed in silicon crystals and silicon based structures, that US
caused an atomic diffusion \cite{Roman:2010JAP,Roman:2007APL},
transformed a native and an impurity defect \cite{Ostapenko1994,Korotchenkov1995,Olikh2009Sem,Ostapenko1995,Ostrovskii2001}
modified  interior surface states \cite{Medvids,Zaver:2008,Mirsagatov},
created new defect \cite{Savkina2015,Virot}.
Defects are known to determine a most of semiconductor device properties.
And exactly the ADI is a reason of US induced variation of tunneling \cite{Olikh2016JSem,Olikh2011Sem}, a generation--recombination \cite{Davletova2009,Davletova2008,YOlikh2005} and  a thermionic emission \cite{OlikhJAP,Olikh:Ultras} current in silicon barrier structures.

The main mechanisms of elastic vibration--defect interaction in non-piezoelectric crystals are considered to be
the  change  of  population  of  impurity  oscillator  levels  \cite{Pavlovich},
the displacement of impurity atoms with respect to their surroundings \cite{Korotchenkov1995,MirzadeJAP2011,PeleshchakUJF2016},
the decreasing of the diffusion activation  energy \cite{Krevchik},
the local temperature increase by clusters of point defects \cite{MirzadeJAP2005},
the dislocation absorption of ultrasound \cite{Davletova2008,OstrovKor92,Olikh:Ultras2016}.
However to the best of our knowledge, the complete ADI theory in silicon is absent.
One of a top--ranked cause of  this situation is a lack of experimental works, which have focused on investigation of acoustically induced (AI) effects.

Not all silicon defects are acoustically active and are subjected to modification under US action.
The ADI efficiency depends on the defects centers type and structure \cite{Medvids}.
Thus, for example, according to \cite{MirzadeJAP2011,PeleshchakUJF2016}, the force acting on the point defect during US loading (USL) is proportionate to volume elastic strain caused by the relaxation of the defect volume $\Delta\Omega_d$.
The irradiation is most widespread and studied methods of alteration of semiconductor defects.
On the one hand, it is shown \cite{YOlikh2007TPL,Parchinskii2006,Gorb2010,Podolian2012}, that high--power US treatment leads to residual changes of the irradiated silicon structure properties.
This effect deals with AI annealing of radiation defects (RDs).
On the other hand, irradiation can be a reason of reversible AI phenomenon initiation \cite{YOlikh2006TPL,YOlikhTPL2011}, which is caused by formation of acoustically active RDs.
Unfortunately, there have only few reports on acoustically driven phenomenon in irradiated silicon structures.


Our goal is to investigate experimentally the AI variations of electrical characteristic which take place in non--irradiated and irradiated $n^+$-$p$--Si structures.
Irradiation was carried by reactor neutrons and a $^{60}$Co--gamma source.
It is expected that $\gamma$--radiation introduces vacancy--impurity point defects (VO$_i$ complex predominantly) \cite{NIEL:Jafari,Gamma:Prabhakara,NIEL:Moll}
whereas neutrons create cluster defects \cite{Rew:Srour,Pintilie}, disordered regions \cite{Neutron:Arutyunov} and C$_i$O$_i$ complex  \cite{NIEL:Moll,neutron:Londos} mainly.
This work represents distinctions of AI changes in silicon structures with different RDs.
The used US intensity was not very high ($<0.5$~W/cm$^2$) to avoid the irreversible defect subsystem modification, which can be deals with a new defect creation, a RDs annealing or a long distance (a great many interatomic distance) AI diffusion.
As a result, the full recovery of $n^+$-$p$--Si structure characteristics was observed after the stop of an AW propagation.
The models of coupled defect level recombination \cite{CDLR:JAP1995,CDLR:JAP}, Shockley--Read--Hall (SRH) recombination, and dislocation--induced impedance \cite{Rsh:Gopal2003,Rsh:Gopal2004} were used to describe the processes in the space charge region,  in the diode base, and shunt resistance respectively.
The interaction of defects with an inhomogeneous USW strain field \cite{MirzadeJAP2011,PeleshchakUJF2016} was recruited to explain the observed AI phenomena.
The investigation would provide not only better ADI understanding but could also facilitate the development of acoustically controlled devices or radiation sensors.



\section{Experimental and calculation details}

The 2 inch (300~$\mu$m thick) p--type boron doped, $<$111$>$ orientation, Czochralski (Cz) silicon wafer having resistivity of 10~$\Omega\cdot$cm was used for fabrication of  $n^+$-$p$--Si structure.
The n$^+$ emitter with carrier concentration of about $10^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ and thickness of 0.5~$\mu$m was formed by phosphorus implantation.
Then wafer surface was passivated by Al$_2$O$_3$ film and further capped by TiO$_x$ as antireflective coating.
Finally the aluminium front (metal grid) and rear (solid contact) electrodes were deposited by screen printing before rapid annealing.
The samples with area of about $2$~cm$^{2}$ used in experiments were cut from the central part of the wafer.

1 sample  was  irradiated  with  neutrons  in  the fluence  of $\Psi_n=4\cdot10^{11}$~n/cm$^2$  and was denoted as SCn.
2 samples were irradiated  with  $^{60}$Co $\gamma$--rays in the  dose  $D_{\gamma1}=10^6$~rad and $D_{\gamma2}=10^7$~rad and were denoted as SCg6 and SCg7 respectively.
The label SCi was used for non--irradiated sample.
To avoid an impact of  long--term annealing, which are typical to neutron damaged structure especially \cite{NIEL:Moll,Rew:Srour}, irradiated samples were stored  for  5 years  at  room  temperature before measuring.

According to data \cite{NIEL:Akkerman,Brauning} the neutron dose and gamma fluences can be calculated as $D_n=4.6\cdot10^3$~rad and $\Psi_{\gamma1}=1.6\cdot10^{15}$~$\gamma$/cm$^2$ and $\Psi_{\gamma2}=1.6\cdot10^{16}$~$\gamma$/cm$^2$ respectively. 
The non--ionizing energy losses (NIEL) and lifetime damage--constants ($K_\tau$) for neutron 
differ from $\gamma^{60}$Co ones by four order of magnitude \cite{NIEL:Akkerman,NIEL:Jafari}: 
NIEL$_n=2.04\cdot10^{-3}$~MeV~cm$^2$/g, NIEL$_\gamma=1.07\cdot10^{-7}$~MeV~cm$^2$/g, $K_{\tau n}=10^{-7}$~cm$^2$/s, $K_{\tau \gamma}=5\cdot10^{-12}$~cm$^2$/s.






The Schottky diode (SD) is one of the most commonly used semiconductor devices.
It has advantages of low forward voltage drop, fast response and low resistance.
SDs are widely applied in high-speed logic circuits, integrated and optoelectronic technologies, including microwave diodes field-effect transistors, various detectors, solar cells.
Determining the SD parameters, which must be taken into account in practical application, plays an important role in the designing and manufacturing process.

The forward bias current-voltage ($I$--$V$) characteristics, according to the thermionic emission SD model, can be expressed as\cite{Rhoderick1988}
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqSD}
I&=&I_s\left\{\exp\left[\frac{q(V-IR_s)}{nkT}\right]-1\right\}\\
\label{eqIs}
I_s&=&AA^*\,T^2\exp\left(-\frac{q\Phi_b}{kT}\right)
\end{eqnarray}
where
$I_s$ is the saturation current,
$q$ is the electron charge,
$R_s$ is the series resistance,
$n$ is the ideality factor,
$k$ is the Boltzmann constant,
$T$ is the absolute temperature,
$A$ is the diode area,
$A^*$ is the effective Richardson constant,
$\Phi_b$ is zero bias Schottky barrier height (SBH).
$\Phi_b$ (or $I_s$), $n$ and $R_s$ are the fundamental parameters of the SD model and should be determined as accurately as possible from experimental $I$--$V$ characteristics.



\subsection{Synthetic data\label{SubData}}

We wanted to test methods at various values of parameters and thereto data were generated in the temperature range from 130 to 330~K.
At the same time we try to synthesize data, which are close to real diode.
The temperature dependences of $\Phi_b$, $n$ and $R_s$ were selected for following reasons.
It is predicted theoretically \cite{Rhoderick1988} and observed
experimentally \cite{Aboelfotoh,Zhua}, that, in the case of homogeneous Schottky contact, the SBH decreases with temperature increase in the way similar to semiconductor band gap.
Therefore the Varshni equation \cite{SiEg2012} can be used to fit the SBH temperature dependence
\begin{equation}
\label{eqFbT}
\Phi_b(T) = \Phi_b(0) - 7.021\cdot10^{-4} T^2 /(T + 1108),
\end{equation}
where zero temperature SBH $\Phi_b(0)$ was chosen of $0.75$~eV.
The temperature dependence of the ideality factor is often described as follows
\begin{equation}
\label{eqnT}
n=1+T_0/T,
\end{equation}
where $T_0$ is within $20\div50$~K to silicon case.\cite{T0:Lee,T0:McCafferty,T0:Saxena,Aboelfotoh}
The value of $T_0=35$~K was used when data were synthesizing.

The Norde method accuracy dependence on $\gamma$ value was calculated --- see Fig.~\ref{figNorde}.
The value $\gamma=1.8$ was used to minimize the method error.

The precision of Werner*, Cibils* and Kaminskii* methods are more susceptible to parameters value then non-asterisk ones.
The most weak dependence of parameter extraction accuracy is observed in the numerical  (especially Lambert LS) methods  cases.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, 16 methods were implemented to extract the physical parameters of Schottky diodes.
To do so, experimental and synthetic $I$--$V$ data were used.
It has been analyzed the dependences of extraction accuracy of series resistance, barrier height and ideality factor on the parameters value and on the noise level of the $I$--$V$ curve.
It has been shown that the use of Lambert function for numerical calculation allows to reduce both the determination error value and the number of accuracy influencing factor; whereas the running time increases.
It has been examined the adaptive procedure, which provide selection of the $I$--$V$ data range for an auxiliary function construction taking into account the deviation of calculated curve and curve under investigation.
This procedure find out to improve the accuracy of analytical Gromov method, especially in the case of low noise level data.
In consideration of evolutionary algorithms, the MABC method is favorable over the DE, the PSO and the TLBO due to the minimal running time.
The most reliable and preferred methods seem to be evolutionary algorithms (specifically the MABC), Gromov method with adaptive procedure and Lee method.
The first one is reasonable in the case of
a small $R_s$ value (a few ohms) or a large $I_s$ value (high temperature).

This work of review, test and comparative analysis of different techniques for determination of Schottky diode parameters should be useful for further research and development on metal-semiconductor devices.
