Dear Editor,

\vspace{2cm}
We like to express our appreciation to the reviewers for their positive comments.
We are sorry for English.
The text was revised and we hope for language improving.

The location of revisions was pointed by blue color and underline in "MarkedManuscript.pdf".

Sincerely yours,

Oleg Olikh and co-authors.
