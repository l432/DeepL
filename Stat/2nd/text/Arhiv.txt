The voltage step was 0.01~V and the current varied from $10^{-9}$ to $2\cdot10^{-2}$~A (to $10^{-1}$~A for data used in Norde and Bohlin methods).

Moreover, the synthetic characteristics have been generated up to $10^{-1}$~A in order that the minimum was occurred in the whole set of plot $F(V)$ vs $V$.

by introducing changes into some of the current solutions, or by combining several current solutions:
$\left\{\overrightarrow{X_{k}}_{,j-1}\right\}\rightarrow\left\{\overrightarrow{X_{k}}_{,j}\right\}$, $j\in(1,\ldots, N_{it})$, where $N_{it}$ is the maximum number of iterations;



It has been found out that the $R_s$ accuracy is mainly determined by $R_s$ and (or) $I_s$ values and methods can be distributed to three following group.


(i)~$R_s$ accuracy of  Gromov, Lee, Kaminskii II, and Mikhelashvili methods depends on both $R_s$ and $I_s$ values.
In this case the plots $\chi^q_R$ vs $T$ are close to horizontal lines for sets of $I$---$V$ data, which calculated using invariable value of both $R_s$ and $I_s$ --- see Fig.~\ref{figRCon}.
The determination error increases with $R_s$ decrease and $I_s$ rise except the Mikhelashvili method --- see Fig.~\ref{figR3D}(a), (b).
Lee method $R_s$ determination error increases with $n$ value too.

(ii)~$R_s$ accuracy of  EAs and  numerical methods depends on $R_s$ value only.
In this case the plots $\chi^q_R$ vs $T$ have a weak dependence for sets of $I$--$V$ data, which calculated using invariable $R_s$ value --- see Fig.~\ref{figRCon}.
The determination error gradually increases with $R_s$ decrease --- see Fig.~\ref{figR3D}(e), (f).

(iii)~If Norde, Bohlin, Kaminskii I, Cibils, Werner or Cheung method is applied, then the series resistance  accuracy remains practically constant in wide range of $R_s$ and $I_s$ --- see Fig.~\ref{figR3D}(c), (d).
The determination error sharply increases at large magnitude of the saturation current (Norde and Bohlin methods) or at large and small magnitude of the series resistance (Kaminskii I, Cibils, Werner, and Cheung methods).

The influencing factors of the SBH determination accuracy allow to sort methods as follows


(i)~$\Phi_b$ determination accuracy depends on $I_s$ value mainly (the Bohlin, Kaminskii II, Lambert LS, and Gromov methods, see Fig.~\ref{figFCon}(a) and Fig.~\ref{figF3D}(a), (b));
(ii)~$\Phi_b$ accuracy depends on both $I_s$ and $n$ values (the Lee, Kaminskii II+Exp,  and Nord methods, see Fig.~\ref{figFCon}(b) and Fig.~\ref{figF3D}(c), (d));
(iii)~$\Phi_b$ accuracy depends on both $I_s$ and $R_s$ values mainly (the evolutionary algorithms);
(iv)~$\Phi_b$ accuracy depends on $I_s$, $n$ and $R_s$ values (the Cheung, Kaminskii I, Kaminskii I+Exp, Cibils, Cibils+Exp, Werner, Werner+Exp, Mikhelashvili  and Ordinary LS methods, see Fig.~\ref{figFCon}(b) and Fig.~\ref{figF3D}(e), (f)).

The SBH determination error increases with $R_s$ rise (with the exception of the Cheung method), with $I_s$ growth (with the exception of the Cheung, Bohlin, Cibils, Kaminskii I, numerical, and Werner methods) and with $n$ increasing (except the Cheung, Kaminskii I, Ordinary LS, Mikhelashvili, Nord, and Werner methods).




The examination shows that the temperature affects considerably on the ideality factor determination accuracy of all methods.
Besides the influencing factors are $n$ value (Cheung, Bohlin, and Cibils methods), $R_s$ value (Werner, Kaminskii I, and Ordinary LS methods, see Fig.~\ref{fign3D}(a), (b)), $I_s$ value (Kaminskii II, Gromov, and Lambert LS methods, see Fig.~\ref{fign3D}(c), (d)), both $n$ and $I_s$ values (Lee, Kaminskii II+Exp methods), both $R_s$ and $I_s$ values (Werner+Exp, MABC,PSO, DE, and TLBO methods, see Fig.~\ref{fign3D}(e), (f)) and $n$, $R_s$ and $I_s$ together (Cibils+Exp, Kaminskii I+Exp, and Mikhelashvili methods).
Predominately the $n$ determination result become worse with the increasing of $I_s$, $R_s$ (except Kaminskii II+Exp method) and $n$ (except Cheung, Kaminskii I, Ordinary LS, Mikhelashvili, and Werner methods).



firstly, the use of the adaptive procedure in Gromov method enables to considerably decrease the parameter determination error, but RT don't become too much.
Secondly, the use of Lambert function for numerical calculation results RT increasing, but determination errors reduce.
In addition, accuracy influencing factors of Lambert LS method are only the $R_s$ value (for the $R_s$ determination) and the $I_s$ value (for the $\Phi_b$ and $n$ determination).
Finally, the most accurate results from ideal  $I$--$V$ curves are obtained by evolutionary algorithms, adaptive Gromov, and Lambert LS methods.
But last one is characterized by large RT and the Gromov method error increases considerably with a saturation current (a temperature) increasing.
