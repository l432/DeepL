\section{Introduction}

The silicon solar cells (SSC) are still dominant in the photovoltaic (PV) field due to their high efficiency, low selling price and process maturity.
Therefore, understanding the way of material properties modification is a top priority for  most of PV device manufacturers.
It is known, for example, the loss in the SSC efficiency is observed in consequence of
excess carrier injection by above-bandgap illumination or forward biasing \cite{LID:BothePP,LID:SchmidtJMR,LIDRev} (so-called light-induced degradation or LID),
high voltage stress \cite{PID:SEMSC,PID:PP} (potential-induced degradation or PID),
or radiation treatment \cite{Bhat,Karazhanov} (irradiation-induced degradation or IID).
Degradation reasons are processes in crystal defect sub-system under external influence.
It is may be a transformation of the boron-oxygen or copper-contained complex (for the LID case),
a decoration of stacking faults by sodium (PID case) or
a creation of radiation-induced recombination centers (IID case).
The partial or full SSC efficiency recovery is observed quite often during of subsequent annealing at an elevated temperature.

On the other hand, it has been shown experimentally that ultrasonic  waves (USWs) can be the effective instrument for defect engineering in silicon.
In particular, ultrasound is used
to affect a carrier diffusion length \cite{Ostapenko1999,Ostrovskii2001},
to vary a current in  p--n structures and Schottky diodes \cite{OlikhJAP,Olikh2011Sem,Davletova2009,Davletova2008,YOlikh2005,Olikh:Ultras},
to transform an impurity defect \cite{Korotchenkov1995,Ostapenko1995,Olikh2009Sem},
to change a spectrum  \cite{Zaver:2008} and density \cite{Mirsagatov} of surface states.
Frequently the crystal and device properties recover after stopping of ultrasound action at room temperature even \cite{Ostapenko1999,Ostrovskii2001,OlikhJAP,Korotchenkov1995}.

This article presents the result of experimentally investigation of the acoustic strain field influence on the electrical characteristic of the n$^+$--p SSC.
Ultrasound has been found to result the decrease of carriers lifetime and, accordingly, solar cell efficiency.
The USWs intensity did not exceed $0.5$~W/cm$^2$ and the full recovery of cell characteristics was observed after the stop of an acoustic wave propagation.
Dependencies of such sound induced degradation on USW type and intensity are presented.
%Features of such sound induced degradation are presented.
The findings are discussed by using model of coupled defect level recombination \cite{CDLR:JAP1995,CDLR:JAP}.



\section{Experimental and calculation details}

The investigated solar cell was created on 2 inch p-type CZ-Si:B wafers with doping level of $1.4\times10^{15}$~cm$^{-3}$ and thickness of 300~$\mu$m.
The n$^+$ emitter with carrier concentration of about $10^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ and thickness of 0.5~$\mu$m was formed by phosphorus implantation.
Then wafer surface were passivated by Al$_2$O$_3$ film and further capped by TiO$_x$ as antireflective coating.
Finally the aluminium front (metal grid) and rear (solid contact) electrodes were deposited by screen printing before rapid annealing.
The samples with area of $1.5$ to $2.1$~cm$^{2}$ used in our experiments were cut from the central part of the wafer.

The dark and illuminated forward current-voltage ($I$--$V$) characteristics of the samples both with and without ultrasound loading (USL)  were measured over a temperature range 290--340~K.
The sample temperature was controlled by differential copper-constantan thermocouple.
Some curves are shown in \Fref{figIV}.

The classical double-diode model of n$^+$--p SSC $I$--$V$ characteristics expressed in the following form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqIV}
\nonumber I(V,T)&=&-AJ_{ph}+\frac{qAn_iW}{2\tau_{g}}\left\{\exp \left[\frac{q(V-IR_s)}{nkT}\right]-1\right\}\\
&&+\frac{qAn_i^2}{p_p}\sqrt{\frac{\mu_nkT}{\tau_n}}\left\{\exp \left[\frac{q(V-IR_s)}{kT}\right]-1\right\}+\frac{V-IR_s}{R_{sh}}\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $A$ is the cell area,
$J_{ph}$ is the photocurrent density,
$n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration,
$\tau_{g}$ is the carrier lifetime in the space charge region (SCR),
$W$ is the  SCR thickness:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqW}
    W(V,T)=\sqrt{\frac{2 \varepsilon \varepsilon_0(p_p+n_n)}{q p_p n_n}\left[\frac{E_g}{q}-\frac{kT}{q}\ln\left(\frac{N_vN_c}{p_pn_n}\right)-\frac{2kT}{q}-V\right]} \,,
\end{equation}
$\varepsilon$ is the permittivity (11.7 for Si),
$p_p$ and $n_n$ are the majority carrier concentration in the $p$-- and $n$--type regions,
$E_g$ is the semiconductor band gap,
$N_c$ and $N_v$ are the the effective density of states in the conduction and valence bands.
$n$ is the ideality factor of the nonideal current components,
$R_s$ and $R_{sh}$ are the series and shunt resistances of the device,
$\mu_n$ and $\tau_n$ are the electron (minority carrier) mobility and lifetime outside SCR in the diode base.
The current-voltage  equation that models the solar cell by  an equivalent electrical circuit contains several parameters related to physical phenomena occurring in  the device.
It is commonly believed that $I_{01}=(qAn_i^2/n_n)\sqrt{\mu_nkT/\tau_n}$ is closely related to recombination in the quasi-neutral region, while $I_{0n}=(qAWn_i/2\tau_{g})$ reflects the overall recombination in the SCR.

We used Eqs. (\ref{eqIV}) and (\ref{eqW}) to fit the experimental data and the $I_{ph}$ (for illuminated $I$--$V$ curves only), $\tau_g$, $\tau_n$, $n$, $R_{sh}$, and $R_s$ were taken as the  fittings parameters.
It was supposed that the temperature dependencies of $E_g$ and $\mu_n$ followed an Varshni equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eqEg}
E_g(T) = 1.169 - 7.021\cdot10^{-4} T^2 /(T + 1108)\,,
\end{equation}
and Caughey–Thomas form \cite{Schroder2006,Markvart}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqMu}
\mu_n(T) = \mu_{min}+\frac{\mu_0}{1+(p_p/N_{ref})^{\zeta}}\,.
\end{equation}
The temperature dependence of the $\mu_{min}$, $\mu_0$, $N_{ref}$ and $\zeta$
%various parameters in Eq.~(\ref{eqMu})
has the form $P=P_0(T/300)^{\gamma}$ and parameters value are given in the \cite{Schroder2006}, Table~A8.2.
The fitting were done by using the differential evolution method \cite{DEWang} and extremely good fit to the experimental data was obtained --- see \Fref{figIV}.

The monochromatic light was used for SSC illumination.
was chosen to avoid
The light  wavelength of $\lambda=900$~nm ensured the electron–-hole pair generation in the $p$-region mainly and low light intensity of $W_{ph}=2$~W/m$^2$ was chosen to avoid any LID processes.
%The monochromatic light with the wavelength of $\lambda=900$~nm and intensity of $W_{ph}=2$~W/m$^2$ %was used for SSC illumination.
%In that case, the photocurrent defined  by the electron–-hole pair generation in the $p$-region mainly.
%If the base is several minority carrier diffusion lengths $L_n=\sqrt{\mu_nkT\tau_n/q}$, the $J_{ph}$ can be written as \cite{Markvart,Razeghi}
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eqIph}
%J_{ph} = \frac{W_{ph}(1-r)q\beta\lambda}{hc}\frac{\alpha L_n}{1+ \alpha L_n}\,,
%\end{equation}
%where $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient,
%$r$ is the reflection coefficient,
%$\beta$ is the coefficient of quantum yield.
%We taken $\alpha$ value at $T=300$~K in \cite{GreenOptic} and temperature dependence in \cite{Markvart} (p.39, Eq.~(18)), and supposed $r=0$, $\beta=1$.
%Then Eq.~(\ref{eqIph}) were used by taking $L_n$ as fitting parameter to fit the experimental temperature dependence of $J_{ph}$.
The short-circuit current density $J_{sc}$, open-circuit voltage $V_{oc}$ and the fill factor $FF$ were estimated from illuminated $I$--$V$ curves by the conventional mode.
It should be noted that $J_{sc}\approx J_{ph}R_{sh}/(R_{sh}+R_{s})$.
In the case of the samples under investigation, $R_s$ was defined by contact resistance and was about 1~$\Omega$, $R_{sh}$ overrode 2~k$\Omega$.
Therefore it is expected that $J_{sc}\approx J_{ph}$.
Really such relation was observed for the $J_{ph}$, which was obtained by whole $I$--$V$ curve fitting, and $J_{sc}$, which was obtained as a point of intersection of a $I$--$V$ curve with a current axis.


In the USL case, the acoustic waves were exited with help of a piezoelectric transducer and were injected in the samples from the base side in the [111]-direction.
The longitudinal (L), $8.0$~MHz in the frequency $f_{U\!S}$ and $0.18$~W/cm$^2$ in the intensity $W_{U\!S}$, and transverse (T, $f_{U\!S}=4.2$~MHz, $W_{U\!S}\leq0.4$~W/cm$^2$) waves were used.
It was reported previously \cite{Ostapenko1995,Olikh:Ultras,Ostrovskii2001} that a characteristic time of change in the silicon structure parameters under the ultrasound action  did not exceed $2\cdot10^3$~s.
In order to wait till the acoustically induced transitional period the following experimental procedure was used.
After USL start the sample was kept at room temperature during 60 min and then the $I$--$V$ measurements and the sample heating were started.
In order to avoid the effect of piezoelectric field on $I$--$V$ characteristics, the piezoelectric cell was shielded.

The samples from the investigated set differed in the shunt resistance mainly.
In the article the typical results for the samples with low (~$\sim10^4$~$\Omega$ at room temperature) and high ($>10^{15}$~$\Omega$) $R_{sh}$ value are presented.
The samples were labeled as SC-R4 and SC-R15 respectively.


\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Ultrasound influence on the recombination in the SCR}

\Fref{figDUS}(a) and \Fref{figDUS}(b) show the USL influence on SCR carrier lifetime and ideality factor respectively.
One can see that USL leads to $\tau_{g}$ decrease and $n$ increase.
The relative change of SCR carrier lifetime $\varepsilon_{\tau g}$ and absolute change of ideality factor $\Delta n$ does not depend practically on the temperature over the investigated range and are presented in Table~\ref{tab}.
The extent of acoustically induced effect is weakly depend on both ultrasound intensity and wave type and becomes more apparent in the sample with a low $R_{sh}$ value.
The longitudinal and transverse USL differed by $f_{U\!S}$ too, but it was shown previously \cite{Olikh2011Sem,Olikh:Ultras2016}, that ultrasound influence on the silicon structures had arose with wave frequency.
$f_{U\!S}$ of the longitudinal USL (L-USL) is greater than in the case of transverse wave using (T-USL) , but  T-USL is more effective (see \Fref{figDUS}, Table~\ref{tab}).
Therefore the crucial factor of the ultrasound influence on the SSC parameters is the wave type.

Before the causes of ultrasound influence would be discussed, the recombination mechanism must be identified.
Firstly the large ideality factor and small carrier lifetime (about $10^{-8}$~s at room temperature) must be accentuated.
An ideality factor larger than 2 cannot be explained by classical  SRH-theory.
Several attempts to explain large $n$ were made with various models.
For example, according to van der Heide \emph{et al.}\cite{Heide}, a nonuniform contact resistance of the front side metallisation leads to a high $n$ value.
However, this theory predicts the dependence of ideality factor on light intensity, whereas change of $n$ value with $W_{ph}$ variation is not observed in our case.
Beier and Voss \cite{Beier} explained the large $n$ by  saturation effects within the SRH-model for several donor-like levels.
However, this theory is unable to explain the magnitude of the recombination current $I_{0n}$, which is orders of magnitude larger than expected for silicon.
The high ideality factor was attributed to deep-level-assisted tunneling \cite{Shah,Kaminski_n} too.
But according to this model, the ideality factor is  fairly  constant  versus temperature, whereas such dependencies are observed experimentally --- see \Fref{figDUS}(b).

At the same time, the experimentally observed large $n$ and small $\tau_{g}$ can be explained by the model of coupled defect level recombination \cite{CDLR:JAP,CDLR:JAP1995}.
This model provides a rapid  direct  charge  transfer  between  defect levels.
Initially \cite{CDLR:JAP1995}, it was suggested, that at least one shallow level participated.
Subsequently the model of the donor-acceptor-pair (DAP) recombination (via deep levels) was proposed \cite{CDLR:JAP}.

According to the DAP recombination model both $n$ and $\tau_{g}$ depend on the hole and electron capture cross sections ($\sigma_p$ and $\sigma_n$) as well as on coupling parameter $r_{DA}$.
By-turn, $\sigma_{n,p}$ and $r_{DA}$ depend on the distance between donor and acceptor $r$ and in the simplified case can be expressed as \cite{CDLR:JAP}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqSigma}
\sigma_{n,p} = \sigma_{n,p}^0\left(\frac{r}{r_0}\right)^2\,,\\
\label{eqRda}
r_{DA} = c_{DA}^0N_DN_AL(r)=c_{DA}^0N_DN_A\left[1+\frac{r}{a_0}+\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{r}{a_0}\right)^2\right]\exp\left(-\frac{r}{a_0}\right)\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where
$\sigma_{n,p}^0$ are capture the cross sections of the isolated donor and acceptor,
$N_D$ and $N_A$ are the donor and acceptor concentration,
$a_0$ is the defect Bohr radius,
$r_0$ and $c_{DA}^0$ are some constant.
In particular \cite{CDLR:JAP1995}, if no carrier  exchange  between  the  donor level  and  the valence  band as well as between the  acceptor level  and  the conduction band are assumed then the total recombination rate
\begin{equation}
\label{eqR}
R=R_{12}-\sqrt{R_{12}^{\,2}-\frac{np-n_i^2}{\tau_{D,n}\tau_{A,p}(1-\epsilon)}}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\label{eqR12}
R_{12}=\frac{(n+n_D)(p+p_A)}{2r_{DA}\tau_{D,n}\tau_{A,p}(1-\epsilon)}+\frac{\tau_{D,n}(p+p_D)+\tau_{A,p}(n+n_A)}{2\tau_{D,n}\tau_{A,p}(1-\epsilon)}\,.
\end{equation}
$\tau_{D,n}\sim 1/\sigma_{n}^{0,D}$ and $\tau_{A,p}\sim 1/\sigma_{p}^{0,A}$ are the electron and hole  lifetimes  for  the non-coupled donor and acceptor respectively,
$n_D$, $p_D$, $n_A$, $p_A$ and $\epsilon$ depend on the energy positions and degeneracy  factors  of  the defect levels \cite{CDLR:JAP1995}.
It is known, that $\tau_{g}\sim R^{-1}$.
Unfortunately, the functional relation between ideality factor and DAP recombination parameters is absent,
but $n$ is shown \cite{CDLR:JAP1995,CDLR:SSP} to increase with the $r$ and $r_{DA}$ decrement and with the $\sigma_{n,p}$ increment.

The capture cross section is known \cite{Bube,Sachenko} to depend on temperature as $T^{-1}$ up to $T^{-3}$ for the attractive centers.
On our opinion, the decrease of $\sigma_{n}^{0,D}$ and $\sigma_{p}^{0,A}$ determines the observed temperature dependencies of both $n$ and $\tau_{g}$.


On the other hand, according to \cite{MirzadeJAP2011,PeleshchakUJF2016}, the force acting on the point defect during USL can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\label{eqFd}
F_d=K\,\Delta\Omega_d\frac{\partial \xi(x,t)}{\partial x}\,,
\end{equation}
where $K$ is the bulk elasticity modulus,
$\Delta\Omega_d$ is volume elastic strain caused by the relaxation of the defect volume ($\Delta\Omega_d<0$ and $\Delta\Omega_d>0$ for the defects
whose volumes are smaller or greater than the volumes of the matrix atoms, respectively),
$\xi$ is the crystal lattice deformation,
and acoustic wave propagates along $x$ direction.
$\partial \xi(x,t)/\partial x$ linear depend on the deformation amplitude $\xi_0=\sqrt{2W_{U\!S}/\rho_{Si}\,\vartheta_{U\!S}^3}$ 
(where $\rho_{Si}=2.33$~g/m$^3$ is the silicon density, $\vartheta_{U\!S}$ is the ultrasound velocity, $\vartheta_{U\!S}^L=9850$~m/s,  $\vartheta_{U\!S}^T=5840$~m/s)




\section{Conclusion}
The experimental investigation of ultrasound influence on the reverse leakage current of Mo/$n$-$n^{+}$-Si Schottky barrier structure has been carried out in the temperature range from 130 to 330~K.
The investigation has revealed the acoustically induced reversible increase of reverse current.
The efficiency of ultrasound influence decreases with the bias and the temperature rising and increases with the acoustic waves frequency growth.
The analysis has shown that the thermionic emission and the phonon-assisted tunneling make a major contribution to the leakage current and both mechanisms are affected by ultrasound.
It has been found that the ultrasonic loading leads to the decrease of barrier height, trap depth, occupied interface state density, Poole--Frenkel factor.
Thus, ultrasound can be an effective tool for controlling metal–-semiconductor structure characteristics.
