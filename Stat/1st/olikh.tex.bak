\section{Introduction}

The silicon solar cells (SSC) are still dominant in the photovoltaic (PV) field due to their high efficiency, low selling price and process maturity.
Therefore, understanding the way of material properties modification is a top priority for  most of PV device manufacturers.
It is known, for example, the loss in the SSC efficiency is observed in consequence of
excess carrier injection by above-bandgap illumination or forward biasing \cite{LID:BothePP,LID:SchmidtJMR,LIDRev} (so-called light-induced degradation or LID),
high voltage stress \cite{PID:SEMSC,PID:PP} (potential-induced degradation or PID),
or radiation treatment \cite{Bhat,Karazhanov} (irradiation-induced degradation or IID).
Degradation reasons are processes in crystal defect sub-system under external influence.
It is may be a transformation of the boron-oxygen or copper-contained complex (for the LID case),
a decoration of stacking faults by sodium (PID case) or
a creation of radiation-induced recombination centers (IID case).
The partial or full SSC efficiency recovery is observed quite often during of subsequent annealing at an elevated temperature.

On the other hand, it has been shown experimentally that ultrasonic  waves (USWs) can be the effective instrument for defect engineering in silicon.
In particular, ultrasound is used
to affect a carrier diffusion length \cite{Ostapenko1999,Ostrovskii2001},
to vary a current in  p--n structures and Schottky diodes \cite{OlikhJAP,Olikh2011Sem,Davletova2009,Davletova2008,YOlikh2005,Olikh:Ultras},
to transform an impurity defect \cite{Korotchenkov1995,Ostapenko1995,Olikh2009Sem},
to change a spectrum  \cite{Zaver:2008} and density \cite{Mirsagatov} of surface states.
Frequently the crystal and device properties recover after stopping of ultrasound action at room temperature even \cite{Ostapenko1999,Ostrovskii2001,OlikhJAP,Korotchenkov1995}.

This article presents the result of experimentally investigation of the acoustic strain field influence on the electrical characteristic of the n$^+$--p SSC.
Ultrasound has been found to result the decrease of carriers lifetime and, accordingly, solar cell efficiency.
The USWs intensity did not exceed $0.5$~W/cm$^2$ and the full recovery of cell characteristics was observed.
Dependencies of such sound induced degradation on USW type and intensity are presented.
%Features of such sound induced degradation are presented.
The findings are discussed by using model of coupled defect level recombination \cite{CDLR:JAP,CDLR:JAP1995}.



\section{Experimental and calculation details}

The investigated solar cell was created on 2 inch p-type CZ-Si:B wafers with doping level of $1.4\times10^{15}$~cm$^{-3}$ and thickness of 300~$\mu$m.
The n$^+$--layer with carrier concentration of about $10^{19}$~cm$^{-3}$ and thickness of 0.5~$\mu$m was created by phosphorus implantation.
Then wafer surface were passivated by Al$_2$O$_3$ film and further capped by TiO$_x$ as antireflective coating.
Finally the aluminium solid contact and metal grid was fabricated on p-- and n--surface respectively.
The samples with area of $1.5$ to $2.1$~cm$^{2}$ used in our experiments were cut from the central part of the wafer.

The dark and illuminated forward current-voltage ($I$--$V$) characteristics of the samples were measured over a temperature range 290--340~K.
The sample temperature was controlled by differential copper-constantan thermocouple.
Some curves are shown in \Fref{figIV}.

The classical double-diode model of n$^+$--p SSC $I$--$V$ characteristics expressed in the following form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqIV}
\nonumber I(V,T)&=&-AJ_{ph}+\frac{qAn_iW}{2\tau_{g}}\left\{\exp \left[\frac{q(V-IR_s)}{nkT}\right]-1\right\}\\
&&+\frac{qAn_i^2}{p_p}\sqrt{\frac{\mu_nkT}{\tau_n}}\left\{\exp \left[\frac{q(V-IR_s)}{kT}\right]-1\right\}+\frac{V-IR_s}{R_{sh}}\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $A$ is the cell area, 
$J_{ph}$ is the photocurrent density,
$n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration,
$\tau_{g}$ is the carrier lifetime in the space charge region (SCR),
$W$ is the  SCR thickness:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqW}
    W(V,T)=\sqrt{\frac{2 \varepsilon \varepsilon_0(p_p+n_n)}{q p_p n_n}\left[\frac{E_g}{q}-\frac{kT}{q}\ln\left(\frac{N_vN_c}{p_pn_n}\right)-\frac{2kT}{q}-V\right]} \,,
\end{equation}
$\varepsilon$ is the permittivity (11.7 for Si),
$p_p$ and $n_n$ are the majority carrier concentration in the $p$-- and $n$--type regions,
$E_g$ is the semiconductor band gap,
$N_c$ and $N_v$ are the the effective density of states in the conduction and valence bands.
$n$ is the ideality factor of the nonideal current components,
$R_s$ and $R_{sh}$ are the series and shunt resistances of the device,
$\mu_n$ and $\tau_n$ are the electron (minority carrier) mobility and lifetime outside SCR in the diode base.
The current-voltage  equation that models the solar cell by  an equivalent electrical circuit contains several parameters related to physical phenomena occurring in  the device.
It is commonly believed that $I_{01}=(qAn_i^2/n_n)\sqrt{\mu_nkT/\tau_n}$ is closely related to recombination in the quasi-neutral region, while $I_{0n}=(qAWn_i/2\tau_{g})$ reflects the overall recombination in the SCR.

We used Eqs. (\ref{eqIV}) and (\ref{eqW}) to fit the experimental data and the $\tau_g$, $\tau_n$, $n$, $R_sh$, $R_s$ and $I_{ph}$ (for illuminated $I$--$V$ curves only) were taken as the  fittings parameters.
It was supposed that the temperature dependencies of $E_g$ and $\mu_n$ followed an Varshni equation 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqEg}
E_g(T) = 1.169 - 7.021\cdot10^{-4} T^2 /(T + 1108)\,,
\end{equation}
and Caughey–Thomas form \cite{Schroder2006,Markvart}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqMu}
\mu_n(T) = \mu_{min}+\frac{\mu_0}{1+(p_p/N_{ref})^{\alpha}}\,.
\end{equation}
The temperature dependence of the various parameters in Eq.~(\ref{eqMu}) has the form $P=P_0(T/300)^{\gamma}$ and parameters value are given in the \cite{Schroder2006}, Table~A8.2.
The fitting were done by using the differential evolution method \cite{DEWang} and extremely good fit to the experimental data was obtained --- see \Fref{figIV}.

The monochromatic light with the wavelength of $\lambda=900$~nm and intensity of $W_{ph}=2$~W/m$^2$ was used for SSC illumination.
In that case, the photocurrent defined  by the electron–-hole pair generation in the base mainly.
If the base is several minority carrier diffusion lengths $L_n=\sqrt{\mu_nkT\tau_n/q}$, the $J_{ph}$ is given by \cite{Markvart,Razeghi}
\begin{equation}
\label{eqIph}
J_{ph} = \frac{W_{ph}(1-r)q\beta\lambda}{hc}\frac{\alpha L_n}{1+ \alpha L_n}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient,
$r$ is the reflection coefficient,
$\beta$ is the coefficient of quantum yield.
We taken $\alpha$ value at $T=300$~K in \cite{GreenOptic} and temperature dependence in \cite{Markvart} (Eq.~(18), p.39), and supposed $r=0$, $\beta=1$.
Then Eq.~(\ref{eqIph}) were used by taking $L_n$ as fitting parameter to fit the experimental temperature dependence $j_{ph}$.
Besides the open-circuit voltage $V_{oc}$, the short-current density $J_{sc}$ and the fill factor $FF$ were estimated from illuminated $I$--$V$ curves by the conventional mode.



The revers current-voltage ($I$--$V$) characteristics of the samples both with and without US loading were measured in the temperature range from 130 to 330~K.
In case of US loading, the longitudinal waves excited in the samples were $4.1$ and $8.4$~MHz in frequency $f_{U\!S}$ and had the intensity of $W_{U\!S} < 0.8$~ W/cm$^2$.
It was reported previously \cite{Ostapenko1995,Olikh:Ultras,Olikh2011Sem,Ostrovskii2001} that a characteristic time of change in the silicon structure parameters under the ultrasound action  did not exceed $2\cdot10^3$~s.
In order to wait till the acoustically induced transitional period the following experimental procedure was used.
After USL start the sample was kept at room temperature during 30 min.
Then the sample was cooled to 130~K.
The cooling time was about a half of hour.
After cooling the $I$--$V$ measurements and the sample heating were started.
The sample temperature was controlled by differential copper-constantan thermocouple.

In order to avoid the effect of piezoelectric field on $I$--$V$ characteristics, the piezoelectric cell was shielded and aluminium acoustic line was used.
The more details about the experimental setup are presented elsewhere \cite{OlikhJAP}.

The data non-linear fitting were done by using the differential evolution method \cite{DEWang}.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Ultrasound influence on reverse current}


\Fref{figIV} shows the complete $I$-–$V$-–$T$ characteristics that were measured without US loading.
To avoid a busy looking graph, the selection of measured $I$--$V$ characteristics is shown in this figure.
Below the reverse branches only are under consideration .
It is  a universal observation that the current from any SD never truly saturates at large reverse bias.
Such "soft" reverse characteristics are observed for structures under investigation too.
One can see that the reverse current change with the bias increase is larger at the low temperature.




Therefore $I_1$ can be described as follows
\begin{equation}\label{eqIte}
    I_1=I_0T^2\exp(-q\Phi_b/kT)[1-\exp(-V_R/kT)]\,,
\end{equation}
where $\Phi_b$ is zero bias Schottky barrier height (SBH),
$I_0$ is the constant.
It is predicted theoretically \cite{Rhoderick1988} and observed
experimentally \cite{Aboelfotoh,Zhua}, that the SBH decreases with temperature increase in the way similar to semiconductor band gap.


\section{Conclusion}
The experimental investigation of ultrasound influence on the reverse leakage current of Mo/$n$-$n^{+}$-Si Schottky barrier structure has been carried out in the temperature range from 130 to 330~K.
The investigation has revealed the acoustically induced reversible increase of reverse current.
The efficiency of ultrasound influence decreases with the bias and the temperature rising and increases with the acoustic waves frequency growth.
The analysis has shown that the thermionic emission and the phonon-assisted tunneling make a major contribution to the leakage current and both mechanisms are affected by ultrasound.
It has been found that the ultrasonic loading leads to the decrease of barrier height, trap depth, occupied interface state density, Poole--Frenkel factor.
Thus, ultrasound can be an effective tool for controlling metal–-semiconductor structure characteristics.
