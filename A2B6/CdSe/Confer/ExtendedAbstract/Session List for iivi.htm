             This talk address the U.S. Army CERDEC NVESD focus
on developing focal plane arrays that have multi-function
sensing capability, combining the ability to image with
the ability to detection hostile fire events or data compression
or even automatic target detection (ATR). Much
effort is directed at improving the underlying read-out
circuits (ROICs) to increase well capacity, improve
dynamic range and perform other on-chip processing
capabilities. As the ROICs become more complex, the
uniformity of the absorbing material will become more
critical. Advances in the state of the art materials and
device processing will be addressed as well as challenges
for the future.

             Since the discovery of near noiseless avalanche gain in 
HgCdTe p-around-n photodiodes 20 years ago, many key developments in 
HgCdTe APD technology have occurred.  Perhaps the most significant 
achievement has been the demonstration of robust linear mode photon 
counting.  We review the major accomplishments in this area and future 
challenges.

             Low temperature carrier transport measurements (Hall 
Effect, Quantum Hall Effect, minority carrier lifetime) are conducted on
 low doped HgCdTe. Multi-Carrier Fitting and Fourier Domain Mobility 
Spectrum analysis are used to extract mobility and carrier density 
values from the Hall effect data.

             The effect of wettability on the surface structure of 
Te-based chalcopyrite grown by the CSS method were particularly 
discussed.  It was revealed that AgGaTe2 and CuGaTe2 exhibited poor 
wettability against these substrates; these poor wettability problem was
 attributed to the chemical property of Ga on the substrate.

             As an alternative to slow and expensive bulk growth 
techniques, CSS is used to deposit sX CdTe on thin seed layers at rates 
of 5-10 μm/min. EBSD confirms (211) orientation with no interface 
between seed layers and CSS material. XRD indicates maintained crystal 
quality.

             Recent progress on HgCdTe by MBE on alternative substrates 
was described in this paper, with lower macro-defect density and better 
crystal quality, as well as the good lateral uniformity. The prelimitary
 results of MW and SW IRFPAs were also presented. The improvement of 
crystal quality on HgCdTe/CdZnTe were studied.

 materials on GaSb substrates with main electrical properties comparable
 to HgCdTe grown on CdZnTe substrates. This demonstrates the great 
potential of HgCdSe materials for applications in next generation 
infrared detectors.

             A brief survey is given of the properties of 2D topological
 insulators based on HgTe/CdTe and InAs/GaSb/AlSb superlattices. The 
character of the spin polarized edge states is somewhat different in the
 two cases, and their wave-functions and dispersions are discussed.

             The highest sensitivity, lowest dark current infrared focal
 plane arrays (IRFPAs) are produced on CdZnTe substrates.  A limiting 
factor in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) HgCdTe/CdZnTe detector 
fabrication is the presence of macro-defect clusters.1  Both the 
as-received CdZnTe and MBE preparation etched surfaces are extremely 
critical for high performance detector fabrication.  In the past three 
(3) years we described the as-received and MBE preparation etched CdZnTe
 wafer surface macro-contamination, polishing damage, and Te precipitate
 size/density in the near surface region.2-4  In this work we will 
examine impurity ‘hot spots’ revealed by the MBE preparation etch as 
defects on the CdZnTe wafer.  Figure 1 is an image of one of these ‘hot 
spots’ on an MBE prep etched CdZnTe wafer after secondary ion mass 
spectroscopy (SIMS) profiling.  The SIMS Cu concentration in the ‘hot 
spot’ reaches 5×1017 cm-3. This Cu level is in contrast to most of the 
sample which has below SIMS detection limit Cu &lt; ~ 2×1014 cm-3.  
Impurity ‘hot spots’ have also been observed in HgCdTe epilayers 
deposited on CdZnTe substrates.  In Figure 2 a defect was examined by 
time of flight (TOF)-SIMS and conventional SIMS analysis.  TOF-SIMS 
showed enhanced Ca, Al, Na, K, Fe, Cu and reduced Hg, Cd, and Te levels 
in the defect region.  Conventional SIMS measurement of Cu concentration
 in the ‘hot spot’ reached 1×1018 cm-3. The impurity ‘hot spots’ in 
HgCdTe/CdZnTe confirm the occurrence of L. Bubulac’s impurity ‘pipe’ 
mechanism.5 We believe that impurity ‘hot spots’ are an additional 
source for macro-defects that limit yield of IRFPAs produced on 
HgCdTe/CdZnTe.

             CdZnTe is the substrate of choice for growth of HgCdTe. The
 quality of HgCdTe grown by MBE is dependent on the quality of the 
starting CdZnTe substrates. We present the case that our current 
state-of-the-art HgCdTe grown by MBE is hitting the fundamental limits 
caused by the CdZnTe substrates. The desired advancements and 
specifications for future CdZnTe substrates are presented.

             We report on the development of CdZnTe substrate surface 
preparation process for MBE growth of high quality HgCdTe epilayers. We 
developed a multi-step substrate surface processing flow to achieve 
sub-nanometer surface roughness, low total thickness variation (TTV), 
and wax or slurry residue free CdZnTe substrate surfaces.

             Twin and precipitation defects remain major problems 
affecting the availability and cost of CdZnTe (CZT) substrates. Twin 
restrains the size of the substrates with &lt;211&gt; direction used for
 molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). And precipitation causes extended defect 
in epitaxy HgCdTe material, which brings about the Leakage current and 
blind-pixel in infrared detectors. In this paper, the twin boundaries 
and precipitation defects distribution were systematic investigated by 
using the combination of Infrared Transmission Microscopy, Field 
Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray Topology. Moreover, the 
growth solid-liquid interface of the crystal was characterized by a Zinc
 component distribution scanner which was designed by our lab. Research 
found that some of the twins in the melt grown CdTe crystals are much 
related with the solid-liquid interface morphology, and the distribution
 of precipitation defects is also dominated by the solid-liquid 
interface morphology. Based on these experimental results, some factors 
affecting the formation of twin and precipitation were also discussed.

             In order to reduce potential SRH centers in HgCdTe and 
enable HOT devices with low doping levels, we are applying gettering 
processes to reduce background impurity levels.  We are also studying 
the effect of anneals on the sharpness of heterojunctions, using a 1-d 
diffusion model and literature data.

             The II-VI material system provides a wide array of unique 
optoelectronic properties, enabling the development and utilization of 
II-VI sensors and optical components for a variety of defense and 
commercial system applications.  Reflection losses over a significant 
portion of the incident infrared (IR) spectrum in high refractive index 
II-VI IR detectors and optical elements limit the performance of 
electro-optical (EO)/IR systems.  However, advanced antireflection (AR) 
coatings can overcome these limitations, significantly enhancing the 
system performance and detection capabilities.
Magnolia is developing ultrahigh performance nanostructured AR coatings 
for a wide variety of substrates and suitable applications.  These AR 
coatings minimize broadband reflection losses through transparent 
windows in both UV, visible and IR spectral bands to less than one 
percent.  This significant improvement in performance over conventional 
thin-film AR coating technologies provides substantial enhancement in 
transmission and consequent performance boost in EO/IR systems.

             Conventional heteroepitaxy requires well matched 
crystalline symmetry, lattice constant, and thermal expansion 
coefficient between the grown film and the substrate to produce a strain
 and defect free film [1]. However, in van der Waals epitaxy, the 
bonding between the over-layer and substrate is due to weak van der 
Waals forces instead of strong covalent bonds. As a result, not only the
 lattice matching requirement is relaxed, but also significantly fewer 
defects are present in the grown film, due to the dangling bond free 
interface [2]. Traditionally, layered materials, have been successfully 
used as substrates to grow other layered materials epitaxially, i.e., 2D
 on 2D. But the growth of 3D materials on layered materials such as 
graphene has found little success until recently [3,4]. Among II-VI 
semiconductor materials, CdTe has invoked intense interest in recent 
years due to its applicability in photovoltaics, aerospace, and 
radiation detection related applications. Hence, it is highly desirable 
to produce low cost, epitaxially grown CdTe films on various substrates,
 which can be fulfilled by vdWE. We have studied 3D CdTe film on 
graphene buffer layer owing to graphene’s inherent advantages such as 
high thermal stability, high mechanical strength, high decomposition 
temperature, ease of producing high quality graphene and transferring to
 any substrate of interest. In this study, we found that the nature of 
the graphene film influences the quality of CdTe film grown on it.
In last year’s workshop, we presented the results of van der Waals 
epitaxial growth of CdTe thin films on commercial, polycrystalline 
graphene substrates [3]. The graphene was grown on Cu foil via chemical 
vapor deposition (CVD) process and later transferred to SiO2/Si 
substrate. This graphene film was then used as a buffer layer for the 
metalorganic CVD (MOCVD) CdTe film growth. But this commercial graphene 
was found to have more than one in-plane orientations [5], resulting in 
extra CdTe domains with 30o in-plane rotation. So, we have replaced the 
polycrystalline graphene buffer layer with home-grown, single-crystal 
graphene films grown on Cu(111)/sapphire substrate. This resulted in 
reducing the number of rotation domains in the CdTe film. The effect of 
monolayer and multi-layer graphene on vdWE of CdTe was also studied. 
CdTe films grown on multi-layer graphene indicated an improvement in 
crystallinity through XRD rocking curve and pole figure analyses. The 
XRD pole figures and azimuthal scans shown in Figure 1, display this 
improvement. Further results will be discussed in detail at the 
workshop.

             The effect of treatment under hot isostatic pressing on the
 grain growth and Fe diffusion rate was studied in ZnS. The treatment 
was carried out at 1350 C and 2000 atm pressure for 100hours. The grain 
size was grown to cm-scale and the Fe diffusion was improved by two 
orders of magnitude.

             Plasma etching is a powerful technique for transferring 
high-resolution lithographic patterns into HgCdTe material with low 
etch-induced damage, which is important for fabricating small pixel size
 HgCdTe Infrared focal plane arrays (IRFPAs) detectors. P to n type 
conversion is known to exist during plasma etching of vacancy-doped 
HgCdTe which is usually unwanted and takes extra steps to remove. 
Etching at cryogenic temperature can reduced the etch-induced type 
conversion depth in HgCdTe according to electrical damage mechanism. 
Laser beam induced current (LBIC) is a nondestructive optical 
characterization technique which can provide information regarding the 
vertical and lateral electrical distribution, such as defects etc. In 
this paper, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching of HgCdTe at 
cryogenic temperature was implemented. For an Ar/CH4 (30:1 in sccm) 
plasma with ICP input power 1000W and RF-coupled DC bias of ~25V, a 
HgCdTe sample was dry etched at 123K for 5 minutes using Oxford ICP 180 
instrument. Without any mask, the sample was then processed to remove a 
thin layer at the plasma etched surface with a ladder-like damaged layer
 remained by controlling wet chemical etching time continuously. 
Combining ladder etching method and LBIC (Laser Beam Induced Current), 
ICP etching induced electrical damage depth was measured and estimated 
to less than 20 nm. The results indicate that etching at cryogenic 
temperature can significantly depress plasma etch-induced electrical 
damage, which is beneficial to define HgCdTe mesa arrays.

             The ternary compound Hg3Se2I2 has shown considerable 
promise for efficient hard radiation detection at room temperature due 
to its suitable bandgap (2.15 eV), high density and high average atomic 
number as well as its large mobility-lifetime product.1 To improve the 
material quality and detector performance, we have investigated in 
detail the electronic defects in this compound using a combination of 
characterization techniques including thermally stimulated current 
(TSC), photocurrent (PC) spectroscopy, temperature dependent 
conductivity, and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy 
measurements. Deep levels with activation energies in the range 
0.70–1.15 eV were measured from the temperature dependence of dark 
current. Below 200 K, a colossal photoconductivity is observed that is 
almost two orders of magnitude larger than the dark conductivity at room
 temperature. Excitation intensity dependent PL spectra also indicate 
presence of several deep level and near-band-edge radiative defects that
 decrease in intensity with increasing temperature and quench completely
 at around 110 K. Moreover, TSC spectroscopy indicates the presence of 
at least nine trapping levels with concentrations of the order of 
1013-1015 cm-3. Preliminary first principles density functional theory 
calculations indicate that the defects observed at high temperatures 
from both the dark conductivity and TSC measurements can be attributed 
to Se interstitials, while the traps observed by TSC measurements at low
 temperature are presumably due to Hg, Se, and I vacancies. Crystal 
growth experiments are underway to minimize native defect formation to 
improve both the mobility-time product and detector response

long-wavelength rejection power on top of a built-in UV sensor based on a
 wide-bandgap II-VI Schottky-barrier structure. It is demonstrated that 
the developed sensing system could detect a standard butane-air flame 
with excellent solar-blind characteristics, potentially capable for

             Conventional heteroepitaxy requires well matched 
crystalline symmetry, lattice constant, and thermal expansion 
coefficient between the grown film and the substrate to produce a strain
 and defect free film [1]. However, in van der Waals epitaxy, the 
bonding between the over-layer and substrate is due to weak van der 
Waals forces instead of strong covalent bonds. As a result, not only the
 lattice matching requirement is relaxed, but also significantly fewer 
defects are present in the grown film, due to the dangling bond free 
interface [2]. Traditionally, layered materials, have been successfully 
used as substrates to grow other layered materials epitaxially, i.e., 2D
 on 2D. But the growth of 3D materials on layered materials such as 
graphene has found little success until recently [3,4]. Among II-VI 
semiconductor materials, CdTe has invoked intense interest in recent 
years due to its applicability in photovoltaics, aerospace, and 
radiation detection related applications. Hence, it is highly desirable 
to produce low cost, epitaxially grown CdTe films on various substrates,
 which can be fulfilled by vdWE. We have studied 3D CdTe film on 
graphene buffer layer owing to graphene’s inherent advantages such as 
high thermal stability, high mechanical strength, high decomposition 
temperature, ease of producing high quality graphene and transferring to
 any substrate of interest. In this study, we found that the nature of 
the graphene film influences the quality of CdTe film grown on it.
In last year’s workshop, we presented the results of van der Waals 
epitaxial growth of CdTe thin films on commercial, polycrystalline 
graphene substrates [3]. The graphene was grown on Cu foil via chemical 
vapor deposition (CVD) process and later transferred to SiO2/Si 
substrate. This graphene film was then used as a buffer layer for the 
metalorganic CVD (MOCVD) CdTe film growth. But this commercial graphene 
was found to have more than one in-plane orientations [5], resulting in 
extra CdTe domains with 30o in-plane rotation. So, we have replaced the 
polycrystalline graphene buffer layer with home-grown, single-crystal 
graphene films grown on Cu(111)/sapphire substrate. This resulted in 
reducing the number of rotation domains in the CdTe film. The effect of 
monolayer and multi-layer graphene on vdWE of CdTe was also studied. 
CdTe films grown on multi-layer graphene indicated an improvement in 
crystallinity through XRD rocking curve and pole figure analyses. The 
XRD pole figures and azimuthal scans shown in Figure 1, display this 
improvement. Further results will be discussed in detail at the 
workshop.

             Very long wavelength infrared Type-III superlattices with 
various well/barrier layer thicknesses and number of periods were grown 
using molecular beam epitaxy.  20 to 296 K transmission curves were 
measured. Absorption coefficients were then extracted and plotted as a 
function of photon wavenumber and compared to that of HgCdTe alloys.

             Two-dimensional semiconductors have recently emerged as a 
potential material system for use in high performance opto-electronic 
devices, and include several materials with small band-gaps suitable for
 use in infrared detection. Here we investigate the performance 
limitations and bandgap of bP-As gated photoconductors and 
heterojunction photodiodes.

             MOEMS-based hyperspectral imagers in the mid-wave infrared 
(MWIR) region have the potential to detect chemicals like Co, CO2 and 
hydrocarbons based on vibrational and rotational emission spectra. 
Current state of the art MWIR HgCdTe photodetectors have high 
sensitivity but low spectral resolution, and hence need to be integrated
 with optical filters to narrow the wavelength range of infrared 
detection. In this work, we report the fabrication and testing of MOEMS 
Fabry-Perot optical filters using electrostatically-actuated 
micro-actuators with distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR). MOEMS 
spectrometers have the advantages of inherited ruggedness, fast response
 times and low cost, which make them attractive for many applications 
including biomedical drug delivery, autonomous vehicles and optical 
communications. The fabricated Fabry-Perot interferometer consists of a 
stationary bulk silicon wafer and a movable MEMS membrane with three 
x-beam configurations fabricated from a silicon on insulator (SOI) 
wafer. A SU-8 photoresist layer was deposited on the stationary chip to 
act as a spacer since its thickness determines the electrostatic force 
that can be applied. Alternating three stack DBR layers of ZnSe and BaF2
 thin films deposited on the fabricated membranes showed a reflection of
  ~ 85%  in the MWIR region.

             In this paper the performance of sequential dual-band 
mid-wavelength back-to-back HgCdTe photodiode grown by MOCVD operated at
 room temperature is presented. The influence of p-type separating - 
barrier layer on dark current and response time was analyzed. 
Detectivity without immersion,  ~ 1.8×108 and ~ 1×108 Jones was 
estimated for peak wavelength = 3.2 and 4.2 micrometer respectively. 
Response time  &lt; 100 ps could be reached in both MW1 and MW2 range.

             A variety of type-II superlattices have been used in 
conjunction with the unipolar barrier device architecture to produce 
high-performance infrared detectors and focal plane arrays from the SWIR
 to the VLWIR.  Progress and challenges in rapidly growing area will be 
discussed.

             SCD's T2SL detector is based on a patented XBp design with 
an InAs/GaSb absorbing layer and an InAs/AlSb barrier layer. Surface 
passivation ensures good stability to flip-chip bonding and back-side 
thinning. The dark current is about 10 times the Rule 07 value and 
corresponds to a minority carrier lifetime of about 10 ns.

             we propose a method to eliminate the valence band 
discontinuity in HgCdTe nBn detector. Our approach is based on utilizing
 δ-doping in the barrier layer to modify the energy band diagram and 
eventually eliminating the VB offset.

             Very long wavelength infrared Type-III superlattices with 
various well/barrier layer thicknesses and number of periods were grown 
using molecular beam epitaxy.  20 to 296 K transmission curves were 
measured. Absorption coefficients were then extracted and plotted as a 
function of photon wavenumber and compared to that of HgCdTe alloys.

             Results from T2SLs exposed to hydrogen-only 
inductively-coupled plasmas suggest that some recombination-mediating 
defects have been at least partially passivated. On average, the 
in-plane Hall electron mobility increased from 1800 cm2/Vs to 6800 
cm2/Vs after hydrogenation, while minority carrier lifetimes increased 
from an average of 80 ns to almost 200 ns.

             First principles density-functional theory calculations 
were performed on a series of InAs / InAs0.5Sb0.5 Type-II superlattices.
 Unit cells were given full structural relaxation with 80.2 Å of InAs 
and 19.4 Å of InAs0.5Sb0.5. The Sb atoms within the alloyed layer were 
redistributed into 13 different configurations representing various 
levels of Sb clustering, in addition to the ordered alloy for 
comparison. Thin 128 atom unit cells, and strain-matched truncated 
thicker 256 atom unit cells were used to explore the Sb disorder. 
Results of these calculations will be presented including the formation 
energy of various Sb clustered structures, and their relative Kohn-Sham 
valance band offsets.

             The DARPA WIRED program requires the development of low 
cost detector technologies with high quantum efficiency and low dark 
current based on colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) of compound 
semiconductors. The authors listed in the team above are targeting SWIR 
(900 – 1700 nm) spectral range detectors. Surpassing WIRED program goals
 necessitates amalgamating diverse knowledge and technologies to form 
cohesive infrared focal plane array (IRFPA) systems integrated into 
cameras.

             Charge transport between lead sulfide nanocrystals is 
calculated following a Monte Carlo algorithm for charge hopping and 
Marcus formula for hopping rates, which explicitly takes into account 
parameters of the nanocrystals and the surrounding medium.

             PbSe thin films were deposited on SiO2/Si wafers using 
Chemical Bath Deposition (CBD) method for IR detector applications. To 
sensitize the PbSe film for efficient IR detection, oxidation and 
subsequent iodization were performed.  The as-grown PbSe x-ray 
diffraction (XRD) pattern shows poly-crystalline FCC phase while the 
Pb3O2(SeO3) oxide peak develops as a function of oxidation time.  
High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) images of 
as-grown PbSe films show FCC phase as well as amorphous C shell at the 
outer edge of PbSe micro-crystals which are formed during the CBD 
deposition process.  The existence of C shell may lead to Pb-rich FCC 
phase with defect states near Conduction Band Minimum (CBM).  The 
presence of Pb3O2(SeO3) crystals was also confirmed in PbSe films after 
long oxidation times without amorphous C shell.  Scanning Electron 
Microscope (SEM) and cross-sectional Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) depth
 profile measurement after oxidation shows the top layer of film contain
 primarily Pb-Se-oxide while film at the bottom layer was primarily 
PbSe.  After sensitization, PbI2 polytype trigonal 12R, Pb3O2I2 and PbSe
 FCC phases were confirmed.  The top layer of sensitized PbSe film was 
found to be primarily PbI2 while the bottom layer has remaining PbSe.  
However, without oxidation, there was no remaining PbSe because most of 
the PbSe was converted into PbI2.  The optimum oxidation condition of 
PbSe film keeps PbSe phase intact at the bottom after the entire 
sensitization process.  Moreover, PbI2 has I-rich phase which is 
protected by C shell around PbI2 grains.  This will give p-type 
conduction on PbI2 semiconductor.  Also, the presence of metallic Pb 
nano-crystals was detected in the sensitized film.  The electrical and 
photo conduction properties of sensitized PbSe film will be dependent on
 final material composition.

             We present a multiscale materials-to-systems model for PbSe
 IR photodetectors. This model combines inter-crystallite majority 
carrier hopping across oxide barriers with charge separation by built-in
 electric fields at a PbI2-PbSe 'vertical' interface. Calculated 
detectivity is calibrated with published data to project performance 
trends with varying pixel size, temperature, grain morphology and 
contacts.

             Northrop Grumman Corporation recently demonstrated a 
thermo-electrically cooled FPA using polycrystalline PbSe directly 
deposited onto 3 inch ROIC wafers.  Excellent performance was confirmed 
for a 320 x 240 format FPA with a measured NEDT of 26 mK and a pixel 
operability of 98 % at an operating temperature of 230 K(1).  We believe
 this is the highest reported sensitivity in a MWIR detector operating 
at ≥230 K.  This sensitivity was achieved by depositing polycrystalline 
PbSe onto oxidized Si substrates by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) 
method.  Highly sensitive and uniform CBD-grown PbSe material is ready 
for production for 60 m pixel FPAs.

             High performance infrared focal plane arrays play a 
critical role in a wide range of imaging applications. However the high 
cost associated with the required serially processed die-level 
hybridization is major barrier that has thwarted III-V MWIR detector 
technology from penetrating large-volume, low-cost markets. Under the 
DARPA WIRED program, we will demonstrate wafer scale, direct growth of 
MWIR InAsSb material on ROICs as a means to achieve significant cost 
reduction of MWIR imagers. Detector performance enhancements in the 
ensuing disordered material comprising of polycrystalline regions and 
grain boundaries are pursued by a two pronged approach: (1) improve 
material quality of the disordered material, and (2) implement novel 
detector designs that are tolerant to dislocation and defect-induced 
leakage or cross-boundary transports. We utilize a metalorganic chemical
 vapor deposition (MOCVD) based Lateral Epitaxial Overgrowth (LEO) 
technique to grow predominantly oriented,  single-crystal-like InAs 
films that nucleate at small openings on ROIC-like templates where the 
underlying Si (001) surface is exposed  to  seed the crystal orientation
 of the InAs epilayer. Lateral growth of the InAs islands following 
nucleation in narrow trenches is demonstrated with high crystallinity 
(as assessed by transmission electron microscopy), together with the 
suppression of unwanted deposition on the dielectric mask used to 
pattern the Si substrate. The MOCVD-LEO process is performed a low 
growth temperature (&lt;450 oC), which is within the allowable thermal 
budget of the underlying CMOS ROIC. Additionally, novel detector 
structures are implemented to contend with the parasitic leakage paths 
encountered in materials that consist of disordered polycrystalline 
regions and grain boundaries. In this talk, we will present progress and
 results comprising of the evolution of our low temperature MOCVD-LEO 
scheme and the performance of barrier-based detector structures 
implemented in InAs-based disordered materials.

             InAs based materials have a wide range of applications in 
diode lasers and infrared detectors due to their excellent optical 
properties. For low cost wafer-scale applications, InAs forms as a 
polycrystalline with grain boundaries (GBs) that are very challenging to
 eliminate and are expected to have a profound effect on the electronic 
properties of the material and the device efficiency.  Thus, an in-depth
 understanding of the electronic structure of the GBs in InAs and of the
 role played by the passivation mechanisms is required. We employ 
first-principles density functional theory to investigate the 
electronic, structural, and transport properties of GBs in InAs. In 
particular, we study the energetics and passivation mechanisms of low- 
GBs not only to calculate their relative stability and experimental 
feasibility, but also to predict the structures of experimentally 
observed GBs in InAs. We find that the symmetric tilt twin boundaries 
are the most stable GBs, such as 3(111) InAs GB, see Figure-1. Our 
predicted stable GB structures are in excellent agreement with the 
experimentally observed GB structures. We also discuss the effect of 
different passivation and doping mechanisms on the electronic 
properties. Understanding the exact nature of the GB electronic 
structure as well as their passivation mechanism is a key step for the 
further development of wafer-scale InAs based devices.

             All electron DFT calculations are carried out to elucidate 
the nature of electronic surface/interface states for several low-index 
surfaces and grain boundaries of InAs. The effect of several dopants on 
such states is also studied. Wavefunction data from these results can be
 used model electron transport across an interface.

             Two-dimensional material, graphene, possesses unique linear
 band dispersion relation with gate voltage-tunable Fermi energy. 
However, due to the absence of van Hove singularities and the atomically
 thin nature of graphene, absorption across the optical spectrum is very
 weak (&lt; 2.3%). The key goal of the proposed work is to increase 
graphene’s infrared absorption to &gt; 60% based on a nanostructured 
graphene film coupled with an optical cavity. The strong coupling 
between the localized surface plasmons (LSP) on patterned graphene and 
the cavity mode induces a large enhancement of the electromagnetic 
field. The proposed detection scheme allows the LSP excitation energy to
 quickly convert to hot carrier energy due to the boundary-assisted 
intraband Landau damping, leading to a directly measureable 
thermoelectric voltage. Fast response time coupled with a electronically
 widely tunable absorption in cavity-coupled geometry will enable the 
development of new classes of graphene-based uncooled photodetectors. 
Note that this charge carrier heating is in stark contrast to the 
standard thermoelectric and bolometric effects, where the lattice is 
first heated, which subsequently heats up the electron system. This 
novel plasmon-induced hot-carrier Seebeck effect in our case involves 
only the electron system and bypasses the lattice system, thereby 
leading to the fast buildup of a large thermoelectric voltage. The 
response time of the detector is then only limited by the external 
electronics, which means that our proposed photodetector is able to 
achieve response times on the micro-second (10-6 sec) scale, similar to 
detectors based on the photovoltaic effect. Frequency-tunable graphene 
detectors not only offer spectroscopic detection but also pave the path 
towards multi-spectral imaging in the IR domain, which is completely 
absent in the present IR imaging technologies. Nanopatterning of 
graphene over large area by conventional techniques like electron beam 
lithography pose technological challenges due to the tedious writing 
process on a fragile monolayer of graphene. The proposed nanoimprinting 
based large area patterning technique will alleviate some of the 
nanostructuring problem of fragile graphene and will pave the path 
towards low cost and wide area production of uncooled graphene 
detectors.

             We demonstrate broadband absorption enhancement in graphene
 in the long-wave infrared using a nanoantenna-integrated optical 
cavity. Electromagnetic simulations predict graphene absorption 
exceeding 15% over the range 6.4 to 10.7 micron, with a peak absorption 
surpassing 38%. We fabricate our device and measure reflection spectra 
that are in agreement with simulations.

             Two-dimensional semiconductors have recently emerged as a 
potential material system for use in high performance opto-electronic 
devices, and include several materials with small band-gaps suitable for
 use in infrared detection. Here we investigate the performance 
limitations and bandgap of bP-As gated photoconductors and 
heterojunction photodiodes.

             The potential performance of infrared focal plane arrays operating at room temperature under
both diffraction limited and background limited conditions is modeled. Operation at the
diffraction limit ensures the ultimate in system range performance whilst at the same time
providing a limit on available system sensitivity in the form of Noise Equivalent Temperature
Difference. The model is applied to predict the available system performance whilst operating at
room temperature of both photon and thermal detector architectures across the complete infrared
spectrum. The limitations required of the various available materials and system parameters to
achieve background and diffraction limited performance are discussed.

             Mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe) alloy is of great 
importance in sensing radiation from the near infrared (λc ~ 1 μm) to 
the very long wavelength infrared (λc ~ 15 μm). Much of the 
HgCdTe-related research and development work is carried out for cooled 
operation. The challenge is to design photon detectors to achieve 
background-limited performance (BLIP) at the highest possible operating 
temperature, with the greatest desire being operation close to ambient 
temperature or to operate these detectors at the same temperature as the
 existing detectors but with much higher performance. High operating 
temperature LW devices would result in several advantages to an infrared
 imaging system. This technology will offer half the cool down time than
 the present technology for greater battle field survivability with 
faster first “image out” and less than half the power consumption at 
150K. At higher temperatures, cooling and packaging are simpler, smaller
 and lighter weight. This will lead to a dramatic reduction in size, 
weight and power resulting in reduced cost (SWaP-C). Increasing detector
 performance would also lead to enhanced hyperspectral capabilities.
The choice of detector material and architecture determines the 
magnitude of dark current, which along with quantum efficiency typically
 determines detector performance. For a simplified, ideal, one-sided 
homojunction detector (with a very highly doped thin p-type region and a
 much lower doping in n-type region), dark saturation current density of
 a state-of-the-art photovoltaic (PV) detector can be written as [1];
Where,
ni denotes the intrinsic carrier concentration, d is the thickness of 
the absorber region, Bo is the radiative coefficient, B1 is the Auger-1 
recombination coefficient, Wdep n is the n-side depletion width at an 
applied bias of Vj, E(Vj) is the electric field at an applied bias of Vj
 and nno is the majority carrier density in the n-side.
As evident from the above equation, intrinsic carriers play a dominant 
role in determining dark current. Hence, our fundamental approach is to 
reduce these intrinsic carriers by fully depleting the absorber region.

In this paper, we present a path to increase the performance by reducing
 the absorbing volume thereby achieving the fully depleted condition at 
much lower biases than those required for conventional detectors. Our 
approach is to reduce the absorber layer thickness to very thin values 
(~ 1 μm) and recover the absorption loss with resonant structures 
similar to R-QWIPs [2].
Note: In the simple homojunction model above, dark current drops 
significantly at full depletion (Wdep n = d). Adroit use of 
heterostructures can further reduce the nn0 contribution by extending 
the depletion region into wider band gap material to further reduce free
 carriers. Absence of free carrier recombination in the depleted 
material will also reduce the radiative background to the radiation that
 comes from outside the depleted region (an effect known as “negative 
luminescence” which is inadequately represented by the B0 term in the 
simplified equation above)
The dark current is independent of the doping and proportional to the 
depletion width as seen in the above equation for a fully depleted 
device. Hence, lower dark current is achievable with thin depletion 
width devices due to this radiative term.

             Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT) Mid-Wave InfraRed (MWIR) 
focal plane arrays are challenged for answering the market demand for 
reduced pitch and improved operating temperature (Size Weight Power and 
Price context) while maintaining a high stability and operability. One 
of the key driver to preserve the detector performances is to lower the 
number of pixels exhibiting extra noise like 1-over-f and Random 
Telegraphic Signal (RTS) (Figure 1).
Studies are made at Sofradir since many years to understand 1-over-f and
 RTS noise and to reduce the number of pixels that are affected. This 
paper will focus on the improvements that have been made since 2011 in 
the MWIR.

             A Hg1-xCdxTe based eSWIR diode is used in a high 
dynamic-range spectrometer. Noise analysis was performed based on the 
dark current data. The operation temperature and bandwidth requirements 
for different Moon phases were determined. For full-Moon operation, the 
detector needs to operate under 220 K and 1 KHz conditions.

             Short-wave infrared (SWIR) HgCdTe electron avalanche 
photodiodes (eAPDs) have been developed by AIM for use with SWIR 
Gated-Viewing systems. Gated-Viewing can be used to enhance the image 
contrast in scenes with clutter from the foreground or background. 
HgCdTe based eAPDs show exponential gain-voltage characteristics and low
 excess noise. The gain achievable at a fixed reverse voltage varies 
with the bandgap of the Hg1-xCdxTe detector material. We show results 
obtained with short-wave infrared Hg1-xCdxTe eAPDs with x = 0.45, 
corresponding to a cutoff-wavelength of 2.5 μm at 300 K. The cutoff has 
been chosen as tradeoff between APD gain and operating temperature for 
SWIR Gated-Viewing applications with target distances of about 1000 m. 
We estimate that an APD gain of order 10 should be large enough to 
achieve a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio (SNR) for these 
applications.

             Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination might be a limiting 
factor of IR photodiodes dark current. This limitation is twofold. SRH 
generation might occur in the depletion region of the photodiode. In 
that case, the corresponding current is called Generation-Recombination 
(GR) current, usually limiting low temperature dark current. Moreover, 
SRH generation might also occur in the diffusion volume, close to the 
space charge region, resulting in an increase of the diffusion dark 
current usually limiting the high temperature behavior of the 
photodiode. Hence, the determination of SRH lifetime of IR materials is 
of first importance and has to be measured (or at least estimated) to 
define upcoming trends in future high performance IR detectors. During 
the last few years, a lot of papers has been published about SRH 
lifetime in III-V materials (InSb, T2SL, InAsSb) and other few 
communications more focused on comparing different material systems 
including III-Vs and II-VI materials. Those latter communications 
proposed very long SRH lifetime (longer than milliseconds) for HgCdTe, 
instead of the classical 10 to 100µs usually admitted until now. This 
paper aims at investigating this SRH lifetime in HgCdTe based on 
experimental measurements carried out at LETI, on HgCdTe grown in-house.
 Direct lifetime measurement (photoconductive or photoluminescence 
decay) as well as indirect estimations from photodiode dark currents 
will be discussed in order to clarify this question of SRH lifetime and 
its consequences in upcoming advanced IR detection structures.

             MOEMS-based hyperspectral imagers in the mid-wave infrared 
(MWIR) region have the potential to detect chemicals like Co, CO2 and 
hydrocarbons based on vibrational and rotational emission spectra. 
Current state of the art MWIR HgCdTe photodetectors have high 
sensitivity but low spectral resolution, and hence need to be integrated
 with optical filters to narrow the wavelength range of infrared 
detection. In this work, we report the fabrication and testing of MOEMS 
Fabry-Perot optical filters using electrostatically-actuated 
micro-actuators with distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR). MOEMS 
spectrometers have the advantages of inherited ruggedness, fast response
 times and low cost, which make them attractive for many applications 
including biomedical drug delivery, autonomous vehicles and optical 
communications. The fabricated Fabry-Perot interferometer consists of a 
stationary bulk silicon wafer and a movable MEMS membrane with three 
x-beam configurations fabricated from a silicon on insulator (SOI) 
wafer. A SU-8 photoresist layer was deposited on the stationary chip to 
act as a spacer since its thickness determines the electrostatic force 
that can be applied. Alternating three stack DBR layers of ZnSe and BaF2
 thin films deposited on the fabricated membranes showed a reflection of
  ~ 85%  in the MWIR region.

             The origin of 1/f noise in electronic devices has not been 
convincingly explained since first reported by Johnson in 1925. This 
paper proposes that the noise arises due to turbulence in the flow of 
the electron (or hole) gas. Three-dimensional transport of gases and 
liquids in the discipline of fluid dynamics described by the 
Navier-Stokes equations includes drift and diffusion plus a tensor that 
includes viscosity and can lead to turbulent flow. Scattering of 
electron flow by phonons, impurities, and other carriers may cause 
turbulent flow to arise at low values of the Reynolds number in 
semiconductors while also dampening their strength. We show that the 
frequency dependence of turbulent mass flow is consistent with a 1/f 
spectrum. The magnitude of the turbulence is compared with data from 
photodiodes as a function of illumination intensity to observe how the 
1/f properties vary with current. Issues associated with this 
interpretation are discussed. Turbulent flow provides a physical 
explanation for Hooge’s “mobility fluctuation” theory and the effect of 
surface states can be understood as enhancing turbulence. Scattering is 
important in reconciling the lack of a laminar flow regime in 
semiconductors. Scattering may also dampen the magnitude of fluctuations
 that are predicted from conventional turbulent theory.

             A physics-based numerical simulation approach was required 
to understand depleted HgCdTe Infrared (IR) detectors and how these 
devices operate when typical analytical treatments of the device physics
 are no longer valid. By depleting the detector AL, the dominant 
recombination mechanism (Auger) is suppressed, ideally leaving the 
detector limited by radiative recombination.

             The optical response of a HgCdTe-FPA is simulated by a 
single broadband FDTD optical simulation, followed by a series of 
discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) and a single electrical simulation. 
This approach allows to save an order of magnitude in computational 
time, compared to multiple monochromatic simulations.

             InAs/InAs1−xSbx Type‐II strained‐layer superlattices 
(T2SLs) are a promising photodetector material for thermal imaging.  As a
 material‐by‐design, the band structures of T2SL absorbers can be 
engineered to significantly increase specific detectivity, and in theory
 establish a new state‐of‐the‐art for infrared detectors.  InAs/InAsSb 
T2SL materials are synthesized in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) reactors 
by varying the Sb flux (thus layer composition) as the epilayer grows.  
The as‐grown T2SL layers may show deviation of their Sb distribution 
from their designs; such as cross‐incorporation of Sb into the InAs 
layers, peak Sb fractions lower than targeted, and alloy composition 
segregation within the InAsSb layers.  These aberrations in the Sb 
distribution may lead to off‐design cutoff wavelength, weaker spectral 
absorption and reduced hole mobility.  Molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulations based on the Stillinger–Weber (SW) empirical potential are a
 useful tool to study the MBE growth of T2SL.  These
simulations can vary substrate temperature and beam flux as a function 
of time, and were used to
evaluate the deviation of the Sb distribution from ideal in multiple 
T2SL designs versus MBE growth parameters.  Strategies to improve the Sb
 distributions were identified and theoretically evaluated through MBE 
growth simulations.

             Here will illustrate how machine learning techniques can be
 used to predict formation energies and defect levels of cation 
vacancies in II-VI materials with a quantifiable uncertainty using only 
inputs derived from bulk properties as evaluated from ab initio 
simulations. We apply our model to alloys within Cd-Zn-Se-Te quaternary 
space and find good agreement with explicit calculations.

             Recent advances in detector technology (PANalytical 
Galipix3D &amp; PIXcel3D), positioning algorithms and signal processing 
allow now Reciprocal space maps (RSM) to be recorded in similar 
timescales as rocking curves with strong impact to the usability of this
 technique. These high-speed measurements find applications of the 
characterization in all crystalline advanced materials. Position 
sensitive detectors allow to collect many points at once and can be used
 in continuous mode, so less measurement and positioning steps are 
necessary to build up a given area of reciprocal space. In conjunction 
with automatic peak recognition this paves the way for a different way 
of working with the well known XRD tool. This contribution will discuss 
chances and limitations.

strain in CdTe / InSb heterostructures.  They layers - at thicknesses at
 least up to 1.8 um are pseudmorphic.  Dymaical simulations of the 
diffraction patterns are consistent with the presence of a &lt; 1 nm

             The ultimate constraint for a solar cell to reach its 
theoretical efficiency limit is the quality of the absorber material, 
namely the inevitable existence of structural defects. It is common 
knowledge that defects will degrade the overall device performance. 
However, in a real device, because of the challenges in carrying out 
operando characterization at an individual defect level, it is generally
 unclear how the defect will affect the device performance, how the 
impact depends on the device operation conditions, and how the impact 
varies from one defect to the other. In this work, we have been able to 
address these questions through investigating and characterizing the 
impact of individual dislocations in GaAs solar cells by applying an 
array of correlative and spatially-resolved techniques, including 
electroluminescence (EL), photoluminescence (PL), Raman, and 
current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. Furthermore, we have determined 
the atomic-scale defect structure using high-resolution TEM for the same
 defects that were first characterized with the above-mentioned 
techniques. We find that a single defect can drastically degrade the 
light-to-electricity conversion efficiency when light is illuminated 
right at the defect site compared to when it is illuminated at a 
defect-free site, through reducing key solar cell parameters, such as 
short circuit current (Isc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor 
(FF), and shunt resistance (Rsh), to different degrees. The impact is 
found to depend on the illumination intensity as well the specific 
defect. This study provides insights for both the fundamental 
understanding of defect physics and the practical knowledge of the 
adverse effects of the defects at the single defect level.
